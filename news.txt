**POOPER TIMES NEWS**

Welcome, everyone, to the first issue of the Pooper Times, the most accurate, unbiased, and reliable new source in G9DE! Since this is the first issue on this server, we would like to begin by giving you an introduction to the Pooper Times.

**Who are we?**

The Pooper Times is founded in May 2022 to produce high quality news material for the members of G9DE. Since then, we have changed a lot in terms of our budget, and alloted time, but our goal still remains the same: to provide you with the best quality news material available.

**How often do we publish?**

We do not abide by a strict publication schedule, as that often hurts the quality of our newspaper. However, we usually try to publish at least on issue every month. 

**Quality Standards**

Here, at the Pooper Times, we have high standards regarding the accuracy and reliability of our news articles. Every article is checked by multiple editors and reviewers to ensure the highest level of quality and accuracy, with the lowest level of bias humanly possible. 

Of course, eliminating bias is just one side of the equation. To ensure high quality news articles, we also need to have accurate facts. Therefore, we have over a hundred thousand journalists all around the world right on scene to provide you with the most accurate facts available. To eliminate perception bias, we often send multiple journalists, at least ten, to report on the same event from different angles.
