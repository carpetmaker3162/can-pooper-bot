**POOPER TIMES NEWS**
Welcome, everyone, to the second issue of the Pooper Times, the most reliable, accurate, and unbiased news source anywhere. This was an eventful week in G9DE, and since not everyone has access to reliable, accurate, and unbiased news, we're here to bring you a summary of the past week.

**STORY: CCP SPY PUBLICALLY EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD**
Mazin Ghizali, a lepidopterist and respected citizen of the G9DE, was revealed to be a spy working for the CCP after he initiated an attempt at revolution on May 9th, coincidentally on the day before Deshpande was overthrown from his long-held position of Supreme Leader (see next article). An unconfirmed number of G9DE citizens was displaced during the revolution attempt, but officials estimate that around 20,000 citizens of G9DE have been severely injured, with around 350 sustaining fatal injuries. Ghizali was executed by firing squad on Huang Square, a public space in the center of Nengopolis, the capital of G9DE. Some political experts, most notably Harrison Lilley, speculated that the execution of Ghizali and his family members may have sparked the revolution that occurred on the following day.

**STORY: G9DE SUPREME LEADER DESHPANDE OVERTHROWN IN VIOLENT MILITARY COUP**
Note: As of May 16, 2022, this article is outdated. Deshpande has been reinstated to an executive position, though whether or not that position is merely ceremonial remains to be seen.
On May 10th, after spending over 5 years in power, G9DE Supreme Leader Shiva Deshpande was overthrown in a military coup led by none other than Head of G9PA (Grade 9 People's Army) Jay Mardikar. The event was mainly in response to the censorship of several demonstrations targeted against the Jaydist Party and its ideology. At approximately 1:50 am in the morning, armed Jaydists stormed the Deshpande residence on Number 4, Capitol Avenue. The Jaydists overpowered some 400 armed guards stationed around the Deshpande residence, and forced Deshpande himself to agree to their terms at gunpoint. The resolution was that Deshpande would be allowed to stay in a ceremonial position in order to pacify the high-ranked Anti-Jaydists in the G9DE, as long as he voiced his support of the new regime.

**STORY: MARDIKAR THREATENING MILITARY INTERVENTION IF PUTIN FAILS TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM UKRAINE**
Jaydist Head of Military and newly established Supreme Leader Jay Mardikar is now threatening military intervention if Putin were to fail to withdraw troops from Ukraine. In a speech on Wednesday, Mardikar stated that G9DE is "not afraid of Putin's aggression" and "will defend the peace and stability in Eastern Europe through any means" before going on to announce that G9DE is preparing for an armed conflict with the Russian Federation. Putin has yet to release a reaction to Mardikar's statement, but some experts within G9DE fear that Putin will react aggressively towards Mardikar's regime. Most members of the Jaydist Party agree with Mardikar's decision to prepare the Jaydist Military for armed conflict with the Russian Federation, but a few members of the Jaydist Party have commented that military intervention is "too hasty" and "fucking stupid" for a regime instated only days ago.

**STORY: LI INSTITUTION TO DONATE ðŸ˜¹60 BILLION TO AI RESEARCH**
The Li Instituion, one of the largest educational instituions in the world, has announced that they will be donating over ðŸ˜¹60 billion (Jayd Dollars, equivalent to around $4.6 trillion USD) to AI reasearch facilities around the world, including facilities within the G9DE. "AI is one of the key technologies that will drive the future" said Neng Li, president of the Li Institution. "Most of the future will be powered by AI and computers, and so if we wanted to start building the future, we should start by investing in AI." The institution will mainly focus on small research facilities with little funding to begin with. "The big guys already have a lot of money, and giving them more won't do any good."

**HISTORICAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: EVERLASTING RULE OF JAYDISM**
Since the downfall of the original Jaydist regime, and the establishment of the Deshpande Administration, it is thought that days of the never ending Jaydist rule was over. However, this was not the case. The newly established Deshpande Administration followed many of the philosophies that the previous Mardikar Administration was well known for, including Jaydism. As a result, Jaydism remained within G9DS (modern day G9DE), only under a different name. There has been many people that has been known to attempt the change the philosophy and ideology that governed G9DS/G9DE for years, but many of them have been purged, censored, and often arrested and jailed for their actions. It is unclear when this madness will end, but sooner or later, it will.
