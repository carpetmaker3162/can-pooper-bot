__**BREAKING NEWS: CCP SPY MAZIN GHIZALI BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE**__
It is common knowledge that Mazin Ghizali, lepidopterist and CCP spy, was executed by firing squad on May 9th for trying to initiate a revolution, along with his wife, Eric Yao, and 6 children. However, the Supreme Court of the Jaydist Federation (SCOTJF) has had many requests for a retrial from the general public. The SCOTJF has turned down all requests until now, saying that "we do not show mercy to dirty CCP spies". However, on May 24th, the SCOTJF has finally approved of a retrial of Mazin Ghizali. On the following day (today), the SCOTJF ruled in favour of Mazin Ghizali, with 28457 Supreme Court judges voting in favour and 28456 Supreme Court judges voting against. Immediately following this rule, the Li Institution used the Resurrection Machine on Ghizali's corpse, and at approximately 9:00 AM this morning, Mazin Ghizali was brought back to life, with his full citizenship returned to him. The government also paid him $20 USD to compensate for his death and to help him get back onto his feet. Mardikar declined to comment on why he authorized Ghizali to be unbanned, nor did any of the 56913 Supreme Court judges in the SCOTJF.
